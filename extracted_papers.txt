Abstract: Respiratory monitoring is essential in sleep studies, sport training, patient monitoring,
or health at work, among other applications. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic
review of respiration sensing systems. After several systematic searches in scientiﬁc repositories,
the 198 most relevant papers in this ﬁeld were analyzed in detail. Diﬀerent items were examined:
sensing technique and sensor, respiration parameter, sensor location and size, general system setup,
communication protocol, processing station, energy autonomy and power consumption, sensor
validation, processing algorithm, performance evaluation, and analysis software. As a result, several
trends and the remaining research challenges of respiration sensors were identiﬁed. Long-term
evaluations and usability tests should be performed. Researchers designed custom experiments to
validate the sensing systems, making it diﬃcult to compare results. Therefore, another challenge is to
have a common validation framework to fairly compare sensor performance. The implementation
of energy-saving strategies, the incorporation of energy harvesting techniques, the calculation of
volume parameters of breathing, or the eﬀective integration of respiration sensors into clothing are
other remaining research eﬀorts. Addressing these and other challenges outlined in the paper is a
required step to obtain a feasible, robust, aﬀordable, and unobtrusive respiration sensing system.

1. Introduction

Continuous monitoring of physiological variables is essential for health and well-being applications.
One of the most interesting physiological variables is respiration. Breathing information is useful for
health condition assessment [1]. It can help diagnose respiratory diseases, such as asthma, sleep apnea,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and non-reversible
asthma) [2]. It is also used to identify heart failure or heart attack [3] and may serve as an indicator
of changes in the nervous system, cardiovascular system, or excretory system, among others [4].
Once a disease has been diagnosed, breathing monitoring may be used during the treatment or for the
surveillance of patients. It also plays a relevant role in the monitoring of newborn babies. Some of
them are born under delicate conditions, and this monitoring may avoid any casualty due to infant
sleep apnea [5]. Older people suﬀering from age-related conditions and diseases, like Parkinson or
dementia [6], and sedentary patients could also beneﬁt from unobtrusive health surveillance [7].

Breathing monitoring is also applicable to the ﬁeld of work health and safety at work [8].
Firstly, having breathing information from workers can be helpful in assessing work-related risks to
plan preventive actions to be undertaken before a work disease appears. The analysis of respiratory
information may lead to the design of safer work places. Secondly, respiratory monitoring may help

prevent job accidents and is especially useful for jobs, such as plane piloting, industrial machine drivers,
car, bus, or train drivers, who can beneﬁt from having breathing information on real time [9].

Respiratory monitoring has also been applied in the analysis of human emotions [10,11].
Respiratory rate (RR) can be associated with emotions, such as fear, stress, anger, happiness, sadness,
or surprise [12]. This can be used to prevent mental diseases and in the treatment of patients with
mental disorders. Human emotions are also useful in psychological studies, for example, to assess or
understand consumer and social trends [13]. They have also been applied in assessing the level of
safety of drivers [14] by monitoring their emotional state. They were also used in the computer science
ﬁeld to improve software engineering processes, overcoming the limitations of usability questionnaires
and helping to provide more personalized web experiences. For example, they can be used to obtain
information about consumer behavior on websites and their interactions. Respiratory monitoring may
contribute to real time recognition of emotions, which is an area of active research in the video game
industry to generate dynamic gaming experiences [15]. There are also applications in the education
ﬁeld and e-Learning. Some emotional states have positive eﬀects on learning processes, while others
hinder them. It is possible to personalize the learning process by providing the most eﬀective resources
for each emotional state [16].

Respiratory information is also applied in the sports ﬁeld to monitor the performance of athletes
during their activities [17,18]. This information can be used to optimize their training or to prevent
health problems. Similarly, it is used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines to guarantee the
good conditions of patients throughout the process [19] and to reduce their level of stress [20].

Another less common application of respiratory sensing is the evaluation of the health of combat
soldiers [21,22]. This has a double utility: it provides information on the integrity of soldiers and
allows collecting ﬁeld information. Breathing monitoring has also been used for emergency situations,
such as rescue of or searching for people, in which breathing information is required in a non-contact
way for faster and more eﬀective intervention [23].

Figure 1 shows an overview of the applications of respiration monitoring.

To perform respiratory monitoring, several approaches were proposed in the literature [24].
Monitoring systems use sensors to measure breathing parameters. There are large diﬀerences
among approaches depending on sensing techniques and sensors, breathing parameters, sensor

consumption, ﬁeld of application, algorithms used to process sensor data, software of analysis,
and performance evaluation, among others. Given that the number of studies and approaches has
increased dramatically in recent years, it may be useful to review existing systems, discussing trends,
challenges and issues in this ﬁeld.

There are several existing reviews in the ﬁeld of wearable sensors. For example, the survey
of Mukhopadhyay et al. [25] focused on wearable sensors to monitor human activity continuously.
They described the typical architecture of a human activity monitoring system based on sensors,
microcontrollers, communication modules, and remote processing. The paper outlined transmission
technologies and energy harvesting issues and predicted an increase in interest in wearable devices in
the near future. Similarly, the work of Nag et al. [26] reviewed ﬂexible wearable sensors to monitor
physiological parameters. The study focused on the materials used to manufacture sensors based on
diﬀerent factors, such as application, material availability, cost, or manufacturing techniques. Diﬀerent
operating principles were identiﬁed: electromechanical, pressure and strain, chemical, and magnetic
ﬁeld-based, among others. The transmission technologies used in the sensing systems and their
possible applications were also reviewed in detail. Finally, the paper identiﬁed several challenges
and future opportunities. The most relevant was the expected reduction in the cost of manufacturing
ﬂexible sensing systems. However, this paper focused exclusively on ﬂexible sensing systems, and no
review of other technologies was performed. In addition, it did not speciﬁcally address respiration
sensing, but instead considered sensors for any type of physiological parameter. Similarly, the reviews
of Chung et al. [27] and Bandodkar et al. [28] also focused on wearable ﬂexible sensors, but speciﬁcally
targeted at sweat analysis. Meanwhile, the review of Lopez-Nava et al. [29] addressed inertial sensors
for human motion analysis. Diﬀerent aspects were studied: sensor type, number of sensing devices
and their combination, processing algorithms, measured motion units, systems used for comparison,
and number of test subjects and their age range, among others. The review identiﬁed a trend toward
low-cost wearable systems.

Seshadri et al. [30] presented a work focused on wearable sensors to monitor athletes’ internal
and external workload. The paper addressed wearable devices for athletes comprehensively, including
physical performance, physiological and mental status, and biochemical composition. RR was
considered as one more physiological parameter. In fact, sensors to measure position, motion, impact,
biomechanical forces, heart rate, muscle oxygen saturation, and sleep quality were also considered.
The paper concluded that wearable sensors had the potential to minimize the onset of injuries and
evaluate athlete performance in real time.

Aroganam et al. [31] reviewed wearable sensors for sport applications excluding professional
sports. Communication technologies, battery life, and applications were widely discussed. The paper
concluded that inertial and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors were predominant in sport
wearables. A gap was detected in user experience studies of existing devices. Meanwhile,
Al-Eidan et al. [32] presented a systematic review on wrist-worn wearable sensors. They focused
on user interface, interaction, and use studies of the sensing systems. Processing techniques were
also analyzed showing high variability among them and including machine learning techniques and
threshold-based methods. Similarly, validation experiments lasted from 2 s to 14 weeks and most of the
experiments were performed under laboratory conditions. Few studies presented real-world setups
with target users. Other aspects analyzed were sampling frequencies and features extracted. Challenges
of wrist-based systems were identiﬁed in relation to weight, battery life, lack of standardization, safety,
user acceptance, or design.

Mansoor et al. [33] performed a review on wearable sensors for older adults. The review focused
on sensor target population, sensor type, application area, data processing, and usability. Fourteen
papers were analyzed. They identiﬁed barriers, such as inaccurate sensors, battery issues, restriction
of movements, lack of interoperability, and low usability. The paper concluded that these technical
challenges should be resolved for successful use of wearable devices.

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

Heikenfeld et al. [34] conducted a review on wearable sensors that interfaced with the epidermis.
Wearable sensors were classiﬁed into four broad groups: mechanical, electrical, optical, and chemical.
Several subgroups were identiﬁed within each category. Body-to-signal transduction, actual devices
and demonstrations, and unmet challenges were discussed. The paper concluded that, in general,
sensing categories had remained isolated from each other in commercial products, and strategies were
still needed to easily attach and detach disposable systems.

Witte and Zarnekow [35] reviewed wearable sensors for medical applications. Ninety-seven
papers were analyzed in relation to disease treatments, ﬁelds of application, vital parameters measured,
and target patients. The paper identiﬁed a trend toward heart and mental diseases monitoring. Sensors
were used for monitoring or diagnosis, collecting physical activity data, or heart rate data. The work
of Pantelopoulos et al. [36] surveyed wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring. The design
of multiparameter physiological sensing systems was discussed in detail. Meanwhile, the study of
Liang et al. [37] addressed wearable mobile medical monitoring systems. Emphasis was placed on
devices based on wireless sensing networks, and special attention was given to textile technologies.
Finally, the paper of Charlton et al. [38] reviewed the estimation of the RR using two diﬀerent signals:
the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram, PPG).

A recent review on contact-based sensors to measure RR was published by Massaroni et al. [24].
This paper identiﬁed seven contact-based techniques: measuring of respiratory airﬂow, respiratory
sounds, air temperature, air humidity, air components, chest wall movements, and modulation cardiac
activity. Several possible sensors could be used for each technique. Some of the sensors identiﬁed in the
review were ﬂowmeters, anemometers, ﬁber optic sensors, microphones, thermistors, thermocouples,
pyroelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, resistive sensors, nanocrystal and nanoparticles sensors,
infrared, inductive, transthoracic, inertial, ECG sensors, and PPG sensors, among others. The paper
presented a detailed description of each sensing technology, focusing on metrological properties and
operating principles. Equations were provided for most sensors. In addition, the study compared the
optimal techniques for clinical settings (respiratory airﬂow, air temperature, air components, chest
wall movements, and modulation of cardiac activities), occupational settings (respiratory airﬂow,
air components, and chest wall movements) and sport and exercise (respiratory airﬂow and chest wall
movements). These techniques were considered optimal for controlled environments.

A previous work on respiration sensors was published by AL-Khalidi et al. [39]. This paper
covered both non-contact and contact-based methods and provided a general description of several
sensing techniques. On the one hand, contact-based technologies included ﬁve sensing methods:
acoustic, airﬂow detection, chest and abdominal movement measuring, transcutaneous CO2 monitoring,
oximetry prove (SpO2), and electrocardiogram derived methods. On the other hand, non-contact
technologies included radar-based detection, optical methods, thermal sensors, and thermal imaging.
The paper concluded that non-contact RR monitoring had advantages over contact methods since they
caused the least discomfort to patients.

Three other related surveys were published, to the best of our knowledge. The review by
van Loon et al. [40] studied respiratory monitoring from a hospital perspective without analyzing
technical items. The review of Rajala and Lekkala [41] focused exclusively in the ﬁlm-type sensor
materials polyvinylideneﬂuoride (PVDF) and electro-mechanical ﬁlm (EMFi), while the recent review
of Massaroni et al. [42] analyzed ﬁber Bragg grating sensors for cardiorespiratory monitoring.

In this paper, we present a survey on sensing systems for respiratory monitoring. This paper has

several novelties with respect to the existing reviews in the state of the art:

•

This review is not exclusively focused on sensor metrological properties or operating principles.
Instead, this paper also reviews all the diﬀerent aspects involved in the design and development
of a respiration sensing system: communication protocols, processing stations, energy autonomy
and power consumption, general system setups, sensor location and size, breathing parameters,
validation methods, details of the test experiments, processing algorithms, software used for

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

analysis, and performance evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst review paper
that analyzes all these aspects in breathing sensors.
This paper does not focus exclusively on RR. In addition, sensors that measure other breathing
parameters are also surveyed.
Unlike previous reviews, this survey is systematic. Studies on respiration sensors were obtained
using objective selection criteria. They were then subjected to detailed analysis.

•

•

Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of all aspects to consider in the design
of respiratory sensing systems. It aims to help engineers and researchers to identify the diﬀerent
options at each design stage.

The structure of this review is as follows: Section 2 presents the study design, selection criteria,
and organization of the review results; Section 3 describes the results of the literature search, which are
classiﬁed into diﬀerent groups, the items of analysis and the results of the analysis of those items
for each study; Section 4 discusses the trends in respiratory monitoring, the issues in the design of
respiration sensors, and the current challenges in this ﬁeld, highlighting the research opportunities;
and, ﬁnally, Section 5 draws some conclusions.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Search and Selection Procedure

A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant papers in the ﬁeld of
sensors for respiratory monitoring. The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Explore
and Google Scholar were used for this review. IEEE Explore is a reference in engineering studies and
Google Scholar provides a broader perspective to complement the results. Four sets of keywords were
selected to perform the searches. To identify these keywords, a preliminary study was conducted
that examined key studies in this ﬁeld. As a result, the ﬁve search terms selected were the following:
(1) “breathing” plus “monitoring”, (2) “respiratory” plus “monitoring”, (3) “breathing” plus “sensor”,
(4) “respiratory” plus “sensor”, and (5) “respiration” plus “sensor”.

To analyze the most recent research, articles from 2010 to 2019 were considered. Searches were
conducted in February 2019 and repeated in March 2020. The sort by relevance of IEEE Xplore and
Google Scholar was used to obtain the most relevant articles ﬁrst. According to the oﬃcial IEEE Xplore
website, the search results are “sorted by how well they match the search query as determined by IEEE
Xplore” [43]. Regarding the relevance criteria of Google Scholar, its oﬃcial website points out that the
rank is made by “weighting the full text of each document, where it was published, who it was written
by, as well as how often and how recently it has been cited in other scholarly literature” [44]. Journals,
magazines, and conferences were considered in the searches. As a result of the ﬁve searches in the two
repositories, more than a million results were obtained. For each search and repository, the 100 most
relevant papers were selected, resulting in 1000 studies. This number is high enough to provide a
comprehensive review of the topic. The title and abstract of all these studies were examined and
those not related to the subject of the review were discarded, resulting in 236 papers. Then, a second
selection was made based on the content of the papers, discarding those that did not deal with sensors
for respiratory monitoring. Finally, 198 papers were obtained. All of them were subjected to a detailed
analysis that is presented in Section 3. Figure 2 (top) shows an overview of the selection procedure.
Figure 2 (bottom) presents the PRISMA diagram that details the item selection process [45].

2.2. Organization of the Results

The search results were analyzed in detail.

For that, papers were divided into two
categories: wearable systems and environmental systems. This is a typical classiﬁcation found
in several sensor-related studies [24,46]. Wearable methods require individuals to carry the sensors,
while environmental methods place them around subjects. The wearable category includes 113 studies,
while the environmental category comprises the remaining 85 studies.

Diﬀerent aspects of respiratory sensing systems were analyzed for each paper. The items
selected can be divided into four categories (Figure 3): (1) sensor and breathing parameter, (2) data
transmission and power consumption, (3) experiments performed for sensor validation, and (4) sensor
measurement processing.

The category “sensor and breathing parameter” includes the following items of analysis:

(1.1) sensing technique and sensor, (1.2) breathing parameter, and (1.3) sensor location and size.

Four items are included in the category “data transmission and power consumption”: (2.1) general
system setup, (2.2) communication protocol, (2.3) processing station, and (2.4) energy autonomy and
power consumption.

The category “sensor validation” comprises several items related to the design of experiments to

validate the sensors (they are listed in Section 3.3).

Three items are included in the “sensor measurement processing” category: (4.1) performance

evaluation, (4.2) processing algorithm, and (4.3) software used for the analysis.

For each category, we ﬁrst describe in detail the diﬀerent items of analysis, except item (1.1)
“sensing technique and sensor”, which was described extensively in the review of Massaroni et al. [24].
Then, we provide the value of those items for each study selected for both categories (wearable and
environmental). Results were subjected to critical analysis and discussion.

This section has been structured around the four categories of analysis introduced in Section 2.2.
First, the items of analysis and their possible values are described in detail for each category
(Sections 3.1.1, 3.2.1, 3.3.1 and 3.4.1). Then, the values of those items provided in the studies
selected are analyzed and discussed (Sections 3.1.2, 3.2.2, 3.3.2 and 3.4.2).

3.1. Sensor and Breathing Parameter

3.1.1. Items of Analysis

This category includes the following items of analysis: sensing technique and sensor, breathing

parameter, and sensor location and size.

Sensing Technique and Sensor

According to the review of Massaroni et al. [24], two diﬀerent dimensions can be observed in the
operating principle: the technique selected to obtain respiration information and the sensor used to
capture that information. For each possible technique, there are several sensors available.

To classify the papers analyzed in this review, the classiﬁcation established in the work of
It was expanded to also cover environmental breathing sensors.

Breathing Parameters

Breathing parameters are the metrics provided as output of the sensing process. Possible breathing

parameters are the following:

•

Respiratory rate (RR): Number of breaths (inspiration and expiration cycles) performed by a subject
in one minute (Figure 4). It is measured in breaths/min (bpm). Other metrics derived from the RR
can also be calculated [10]:

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

Breathing period: Time duration of a breathing cycle(s).
Inspiratory time: Part of the breathing period that corresponds to inspiration (s). According
to Figure 4A, it can be obtained as tb
Expiratory time: Part of the breathing period that corresponds to expiration (s). According
to Figure 4A, it can be obtained as td

•

Volume parameters: Metrics that provide volume information obtained from inhaled or exhaled
air during breathing. Volume metrics comprise a set of sub-metrics related to the volume of
air available in the lungs [47]. Some of the metrics that could be found in the breathing sensor
studies were:

− Vn| = |Vn − Vn−1

Tidal volume (TV): It is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled during normal respiration
(without forcing breathing). It is measured in liters (L). From the volume versus time
signal represented in Figure 4B, the TV for a given breathing period could be calculated
|, where Vn is the air volume associated with the n
as TV = |Vn−1
respiration peak or valley.
Minute volume (MV): It is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled by a subject in one minute
during normal breathing. It is measured in L/min. It can be roughly obtained from the
TV and the RR as MV = TV·RR. From the representation of Figure 4B, the MV can be
− Vi|; ∀i ∈ Z : i ∈ [2, n] : 2|i , where n is the number of peaks

calculated as MV =

|Vi−1

− Va)/(tb

(or valleys) in the air volume curve that can be found in one minute of breathing.
Peak inspiration ﬂow (PIF): According to Warner and Patel [47], it is the maximum ﬂow at
which a given tidal volume breath can be delivered. It is measured in L/min. From the
− ta), where (Va, ta) is
representation of Figure 4B, it can be obtained as PIF = (Vb
the point associated with the valley in the time-volume curve before inspiration, and (Vb, tb)
is the point related to the peak of inspiration at which the given tidal volume is delivered.
Exhalation ﬂow rate (EFR): Volume of air exhaled per time unit. It is expressed in L/s
and can be calculated as EFR = (Volume o f exhaled air)/(Exhalation time) [48]. From the
− t3), where (V3, t3)
representation of Figure 4B, it can be obtained as EFR = (V3
is the point corresponding to a peak of the time-volume curve, and (V4, t4) is the next
valley of the curve.
There are other air volume metrics, such as peak expiratory ﬂow (maximum ﬂow at
which a given tidal volume can be exhaled; it can be obtained as (Vc − Vd)/(td
− tc) from
Figure 4B), vital capacity (volume of air expired after deep inhalation; it can be obtained as
Ve − V f from Figure 4B), or forced vital capacity (same as vital capacity but maximizing
the expiratory eﬀort; it can be obtained as Vg − Vh from Figure 4B), among others [49].
They have barely been used in breathing sensor studies.
Compartmental volume: Instead of considering air volume, this metric measures the change
in volume of breathing-related body parts, like chest, thorax, or abdomen [49].

Respiration patterns: There are studies in which the purpose is to identify patterns in the signals
obtained from the recording of respiration instead of providing a particular breathing parameter.
Common patterns identiﬁed are abnormal breathing [50–52], apnea episodes [50,51,53,54],
Kussmaul’s respiration, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, Biot’s respiration, Cheyne-Stokes variant,
or dysrhythmic breathing, among others [53]. There are also studies that identiﬁed the type
of breathing (heavy or shallow breathing, mouth breathing, abdominal breathing, or chest
breathing) [53].

Sensor Location and Size

Sensor location and size play a relevant role in system usability and can determine the acceptability
of the technology by its potential users [55,56]. Figure 5 shows possible locations for wearable systems.
The locations are chest (diaphragm or pectoral muscle), abdomen, waist, arm, forearm, ﬁnger, mouth

can be integrated into an object commonly used by the subject (pillow, mat, mattress, etc.), or can be
distributed on nodes, among others. The location of a sensor largely depends on its operating principle
and the speciﬁc application.

In relation to the sensing techniques and sensors, Figures 6 and 7 show the main results
for the wearable and environmental categories, respectively. Most authors chose to detect chest
wall movements (60%). For the environmental category, modulation of cardiac activity was also

techniques in the wearable category, at great distance. In this category, ﬁber optic sensors were used in
almost 19% of the studies, resistive sensors in 15%, accelerometers in more than 11%, and capacitive
sensors in more than 9%. Great variability in sensors can be found in studies of this category,
as there is no predominant type. This contrasts with the environmental category since radars are
used in more than 33% of the studies, being the leading technology followed by cameras (18%)
and ﬁber optic sensors (14%). There are types of sensors, such as magnetometers, gyroscopes,
microphones, optical sensors, inductive sensors, or thermistors, in which its use is very limited in both
categories [62,73,76,77,81,91,95,106,107,115,119,120,131,135,156,160,162,185,193,217].

Items of Analysis This category includes the following items of analysis: general system setup, communication protocol, processing station, and energy autonomy and power consumption. General System Setup Different configurations can be found in systems for respiratory monitoring depending on the data transmission architecture. Systems can be roughly divided into two categories (Figure 11): (A) those that perform data processing on a centralized processing platform and (B) those that perform data processing near the remote sensing unit. • Systems that perform centralized processing: Data processing is done in a centralized system that does not need to be close to the subject being monitored. The magnitude values registered by the sensors are acquired and conditioned [24] and then transmitted to a centralized processing unit. Three different approaches can be found depending on the specific point where the acquisition & conditioning module and transmission module are placed: o The acquisition & conditioning and transmission modules are in the same package as the sensing unit (cases 1.x of Figure 11A, ∀(cid:1876)∈[1..2]). o The acquisition & conditioning module is in the same package as the sensing unit, but the transmission module is placed externally (cases 2.x of Figure 11A, ∀(cid:1876)∈[1..2]). o Both the acquisition & conditioning and transmission modules are not included in the same package as the sensing unit (cases 3.x of Figure 11A, ∀(cid:1876)∈[1..2]). For all three approaches, data visualization can be done in two different ways: next to the processing unit of the registered signals (cases 1.1, 2.1, and 3.1 of Figure 11A) or at a different point (cases 2.1, 2.2, and 3.2 of Figure 11A). • Systems that perform remote processing: Processing of breathing signals to determine the respiratory parameters of interest is performed near the subject whose breathing is being monitored. Three different setups are possible depending on whether the acquisition & conditioning module and the processing module are included in the same package as the sensing unit: o The acquisition & conditioning circuits, the microcontroller for the processing and the data transmission module are placed in the same package as the sensing unit (cases 4.x of Figure 11B, ∀(cid:1876)∈[1..2]).  0510152025303540Distance fromsubject(front/above)User's mat/pillowNodesOthersNot specifiedNumber of studiesSensors 2020, 20, 5446

Communication Protocol

Communication between the diﬀerent modules of the system can be classiﬁed according to

whether it is wired or wireless:

• Wired transmission: All system elements (sensing, acquisition, conditioning, transmission,
processing, and visualization) are physically connected. The USB (universal serial bus) protocol is
the most common way of transmitting the acquired respiratory signals.

• Wireless transmission: Subjects wear the sensing system without cable connections to other
elements of the system. The transmission and reception of measurements is carried out through a

Bluetooth: It is a standard and communication protocol for personal area networks. It is
suitable for applications that require continuous data transmission with a medium data
transmission rate (up to 1 Mbps). It uses a radio communication system, which means that
the transmitting and receiving devices do not need to be in line of sight. It operates in the
2.4–2.485 GHz band with a low transmission distance (1 to 100 m, typically). There are ﬁve
Bluetooth classes (1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4). Most Bluetooth-based respiration monitoring systems
use class 2 or higher. This means that the transmission distance is short (less than 10 m,
in general), but the power consumption is also moderate [237].
Wi-Fi: This technology is generally used for local area networks instead of personal
area networks, like Bluetooth. It has much higher data transmission rates and power
consumption is also higher. At a typical 2.4 GHz operating frequency, it can consume
a maximum of 100 mW. Wi-Fi operating band is in the 2.4–5 GHz range. In general,
the transmission range is between 50 m and 100 m, although it can be greatly extended in
some conditions. This technology is suitable for applications where constant high-speed
data transmission is required, the transmission distance is relatively large, and power
consumption is not an issue [238].
GSM/GPRS: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a standard for mobile
communication that belongs to the second-generation (2G) of digital cellular networks.
It requires base stations to which the mobile devices connect. The coverage range of base
stations varies from a few meters to dozen of kilometers. Within this 2G technology, it is
also possible to ﬁnd the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), which is data-oriented.
The transmission rate of GPRS is low (around 120 kbps, although this rate is usually lower
in real conditions) with a limitation of 2 W of power consumption. The frequency band of
this technology is in the range of 850–1900 MHz [239].
Zigbee: It is a speciﬁcation of several high-level communication protocols. Zigbee is used
for the creation of personal area networks that do not need high data transmission rates.
ZigBee can operate in the industrial, medical and scientiﬁc radio bands, which may vary
among countries. This is the reason why it generally works in the 2.4 GHz band that is
available worldwide. If the system operates in the 2.4 GHz band, its data transmission rate
is 250 kbps. Devices using this technology are generally inexpensive since the required
microprocessor is simple due to the low transmission rate of Zigbee. Power consumption is
low since nodes can be asleep until some information is received. It is useful for applications
that do not require constant transmission. The range of transmission distance is similar to
that of Bluetooth technology [237].
Radio frequency: These modules are suitable for applications that do not need a high speed
of data transmission. Radio frequency works in the Ultra High Frequency band (433 MHz)
and requires a receiver-transmitter pair. It is low power and cheap, with a small module
size. Communication range is from 20 to 200 m. This range depends on the input voltage
of the module: at higher voltages, greater communication distance is reached. Working
voltage for this technology ranges from 3.5 to 12 V. Radio broadcasting is performed
through amplitude modulation. Radio frequency requires both receivers and transmitters
to incorporate a microcontroller module. Typical power consumption is up to 10 mW.

Energy Autonomy and Power Consumption

Regarding the power supply, systems can be categorized according to whether (1) they harvest
part of the energy required for system operation, (2) they use rechargeable batteries, or (3) they are
directly connected to a power source through a cable. This section analyses the ﬁrst two categories
in more detail since systems connected to a power source are of less interest as they have unlimited
power availability.

(1) Energy Harvesters

Few were the studies found in the systematic searches conducted in this review that harvested
energy [77,84,104]. However, some energy harvesting techniques have been reported experimentally in
other wearable systems [240–249]. This section presents a description of these techniques and how they
were implemented in the respiratory sensing systems. They were based on magnetic induction, piezo
electric eﬀect, triboelectric power generation, pyroelectric eﬀect, thermoelectric eﬀect, electrostatic
power generation, and solar cells.

• Magnetic induction generator: A small electric generator can be used to transform mechanical
energy into electrical energy according to Faraday’s law. An electric current is induced in the
generator coils by a changing magnetic ﬁeld produced by the movement of the rotor due to
the mechanical energy applied to it during breathing. The amount of generated voltage can be
calculated according to Equation (1) [135].

V = − N × K1

× d∆CChest

where N is the number of turns of the coil, ∆CChest is the circumference change of the chest, K2 is the
proportionality constant between ∆CChest and the angular displacement, and K1 is the proportionality
constant between the magnetic ﬂux and the rate of change of the angular displacement. The prototype
presented by Padasdao et al. [135] attached the motor to a plastic housing with an armature ﬁxed to
the rotor gears (or shaft) (Figure 13A). A non-elastic wire was wrapped around the chest. One side of
the wire was ﬁxed to the plastic housing and the other end was attached to the armature. A piece of
hard felt was ﬁxed to the housing to help stabilize the device against the body. A spring was attached
between the armature and the plastic housing to provide a restoring force to the armature. During
inspiration, the non-elastic wire pulled the armature, leading to rotor rotation. During expiration,
the spring pulled the armature back, leading to rotor rotation in the opposite direction. In this way,
energy was harvested. In the work of Padasdao et al. [135], the electrical signal generated was used
to obtain the RR instead of supplying power to the system. However, this is an example of how
respiratory movements can be converted into electrical energy.

Other respiration-based energy harvesting systems can be found in the literature. The works of
Delnavaz et al. [240] and Goreke et al. [241] used air ﬂow to produce power with magnetic induction
generators. On the one hand, the prototype of Delnavaz et al. [240] was made up of two ﬁxed magnets
located at the ends of a tube (opposite poles facing each other) with a free magnet inside the tube
(Figure 13B). The free magnet was suspended due to the repulsive forces with the ﬁxed magnets. A coil
was wrapped around the outside of the tube. When a subject breathed into the tube, the free magnet
moved around its static position. In this way, a voltage was induced in the coil since it was crossed by
a variable magnetic ﬁeld, which caused the magnetic induction. Experimental results showed that
more than 3 µW were generated. The induced voltage in a closed circuit (U) was proportional to the
magnetic ﬂux gradient (dφ/dx) and the velocity of the magnet (dx/dt), according to Equation (2).

On the other hand, a microelectromechanical-scale turbine was presented by Goreke et al. [241].
The turbine had 12 blades on its outer contour and ball bearings around the center embedded in
grooves (Figure 13C). A permanent magnet was integrated in the area between the ball bearings and the
turbine blades. The entire prototype was encapsulated in a package with rectangular openings for the
airﬂow. The prototype presented was under development and not fully implemented. The operating
principle of the system could be as follows: by ﬂowing air for the rectangular openings, the blades
rotate and move the turbine in such a way that its coils see a variable magnetic ﬁeld generated by the

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

Piezoelectric energy harvesting: These harvesters generate a voltage when compressed or
stretched [242]. In the work of Shahhaidar et al. [242], they were embedded in a belt alongside the
chest. Due to low capacitance of the piezoresistive materials, the overall harvested energy was low.
Therefore, this piezoresistive conﬁguration was unable to provide the necessary energy to power
the entire system. The main drawback to adopting this energy harvesting technique for respiration
sensors is that the required vibration frequency is much higher than the respiration frequency.
In this sense, the paper of Li et al. [243] presented a prototype based on the interaction between a
piezoelectric cantilever and a magnet placed on a substrate (Figure 14B). The vertical vibration
of the cantilever due to the magnet presence allowed generating a constant amount of energy.
The substrate with the magnet was attached to subject body (a limb joint). The movements of the
subject led to substrate stretching and contraction, which caused the vibration of the piezoelectric
cantilever. The energy generated was stable for diﬀerent types of movements, since it was tested
on diﬀerent parts of the body. The energy harvester worked correctly for subject movements in the
frequency range of 0.5–5.0 Hz. It has potential to be used with breathing movements. Meanwhile,
Wang et al. [244] presented a piezoelectric rubber band that could be mounted on an elastic
waistband to generate electricity from the circumferential stretch caused by breathing. The paper
showed a structure made up of top and bottom electrodes with two solid layers and one void layer
in between (Figure 14A). They were made of composite polymeric and metallic microstructures
with embedded bipolar charges. Finally, the work of Sun et al. [245] presented an energy harvester
from respiration air ﬂow based on the piezoelectric eﬀect. They used piezoelectric polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride (PVDF) microbelts that oscillated under low-speed airﬂow to generate electrical power in
the order of magnitude of µW (Figure 14C).

The operating principle of the system could be as follows: by flowing air for the rectangular openings, the blades rotate and move the turbine in such a way that its coils see a variable magnetic field generated by the fixed magnet.

Triboelectric energy harvesting: They generate charges by rubbing two diﬀerent materials (one is an
electron donor and the other is an electron acceptor), resulting in the creation of a potential in the
contact region [250]. One possible setup is to attach the tribo-pair to a belt to detect variations
in abdominal circumference. Triboelectric generators were used in breathing studies as a means
of measuring RR, but not as energy harvesters, since the power generated is low for the power
requirements of the entire respiration monitoring system that includes also a data transmission
module. In the work of Zhang et al. [246] two belts (one extensible and one inextensible) were
attached to each side of two materials (Figure 15A). A mechanical experiment was performed to
obtain the peak voltage for diﬀerent sliding amplitudes in the range of 2.5 to 30 mm that represents
the typical displacement of a breathing depth. The result of this experiment was Equation (3).

Vpeak = 0.01383XMax + 0.0092,

(3)

where Vpeak is the peak value of the voltage, and the Xmax is the maximum sliding displacement of
the tribo-pair. A similar approach was proposed by Zhang et al. [77]. They presented a tribo-pair
with both sides of one material ﬁxed to two “Z-shaped” connectors that were attached to a belt
with an inextensible part and an extensible part (Figure 15B). The abdominal contraction and
expansion associated with respiration caused deformation of the two “Z-shaped” connectors.
This deformation led to a process of contact and separation of the tribo-pair, generating an
electrical signal.

A self-powered respiratory sensor and energy harvester was also shown in the work of
Vasandani et al. [247]. The working principle was very similar to the work of Zhang et al. [77]
but, in this case, a prototype was built with movable and ﬁxed supports (Figure 15C). The two materials
were ﬁxed to these two supports. The movements associated with respiration caused an angular
displacement of the movable support by means of a belt and a lever mechanism, harvesting energy.
◦
The voltage obtained between the electrodes was zero in case of full contact and rose to 9.34 V for a 60
separation. The maximum area power density was 7.584 mW/m2.

Electrostatic energy harvesting: It is based on the change of parameters of a capacitive device,
which is called electrostatic energy harvester. Breathing may cause separation of the capacitor
plates or modiﬁcation of the plate area, among others [251]. This energy harvesting technique is
not common in respiratory systems. The prototype of Seo et al. [248] showed a capacitor made
of two metal electrodes and an insulating layer in between. The capacitance of the prototype
varied with respiration. This was because the area of the top electrode was variable depending
on the presence of a wet surface associated with respiration (Figure 16). Humid exhaled breath
air was cooled by the ambient air on the top surface of the insulated material. Thus, the water
molecules were condensed, acting as part of the upper electrode and changing the capacitance
of the prototype. This condensation provided a thick layer that became part of the electrode.
Then, the water naturally evaporated due to its vapor pressure and the device returned to its
original status. The variable capacitance allowed the charges to circulate, harvesting electrostatic
energy. The prototype presented in Reference [248] reported a generated power of 2 µW/cm2.
Pyroelectric energy harvesting: These harvesters are based on the reorientation of dipoles owing to
temperature ﬂuctuations [252]. Therefore, they need a temperature variation in time. Xue et al. [249]

electrodes and mounted on the respirator of a mask at the location where air ﬂows during breathing

Thermoelectric energy harvesting: These harvesters are based on the Seebeck eﬀect. They convert
a temperature gradient into electric power. Therefore, they need a temperature variation in
space [253]. A thermoelectric module is an array of p-type and n-type semiconductors. According
to Nozariasbmarz et al. [252], the conversion eﬃciency of a thermoelectric generator can be
calculated as:

wrist for thermoelectric power generation.

Solar cells: This technology has been also used to power respiratory sensing systems. The energy
produced by the solar cells is stored in a battery through a charge regulator that also controls the
discharge of the battery to power the sensing system. The charge regulator controls that both the
battery and the sensing system are supplied with adequate voltage and current levels. Figure 18

Power autonomy determines the viability of a system. The autonomy of a battery-powered
respiration sensing system is obtained by calculating or measuring its battery life, which is deﬁned
as the time that a system can operate with a fully charged battery. Two diﬀerent factors must be
determined when performing tests to measure battery life: system operating mode and the way of
measuring battery life.

Regarding system operating mode, there are essentially two diﬀerent approaches:

•
•

Continuous operation: Battery life is measured with the breathing device operating continuously.
Continuous operation + inactivity periods: A typical daily use of the system is considered, which may
include certain inactivity periods in which the device is in “idle” mode or even oﬀ (not used).

Regarding the way of measuring battery life, it should be noticed that it depends on the type of
battery used and its parameters. The main parameter of a battery is its capacity, which determines
the nominal amount of charge that can be stored. It is usually expressed in mAh. As a general rule,
the higher the capacity, the longer the battery life. However, capacity depends on several external
factors, such as discharge rate, operating temperature, aging, and state of charge (SOC). When a battery
is discharged at low rate (low current), the energy is delivered more eﬃciently. Higher discharge
rates (higher currents demanded by the breathing system) lead to a reduction in eﬀective battery
capacity [255]. Temperature also aﬀects battery capacity in such a way that low temperatures decrease
capacity. Aging may also decrease the capacity [256]. If a battery is not full, the state of charge (SOC)
must also be considered. It represents the percentage of capacity that is currently available with respect
to the rated capacity.

The most common and sensible approach is that tests are conducted with a new fully-charged
battery that operates in the nominal temperature range and discharges within the nominal current
range. Under these conditions, the nominal capacity of the battery can be considered its true capacity.
Otherwise, diﬀerent reduction factors (<1) should be applied to rated capacity. Therefore, diﬀerent
ways to measure battery life experimentally can be found in existing studies:

• Measure of battery life directly: A battery can be considered discharged when the voltage drops
below a certain value (3.6 V [257] for common small batteries). Therefore, by taking a full battery
and monitoring the output voltage, it is possible to obtain battery life with expression (7).

BatteryLi f e (h) = InitialTime − DischargeTime.

(7)

• Measure of current consumption: Current consumption of the respiratory sensing system can be
measured experimentally or estimated from the datasheets of the system components. The formula
for calculating battery life is diﬀerent for each operation mode:

Continuous operation: The system is assumed to operate continuously consuming an average
current value.

∈ R[0, 1] are reduction factors of the capacity to
where SOC f actor, C f actor, Ta f actor, Age f actor
be applied in case tests are not performed under the optimal conditions mentioned above,
and OC is the average value of the operating current.
Continuous operation + inactivity periods (rough estimate): Current consumption in the
operation and inactivity periods is assumed to be “constant”.

(cid:35)

where IC(mAh) is the average value of current consumed by the system in idle or non-active
modes, nminoc is the number of minutes that the breathing system is in operation mode
during a certain period of time (for instance, one day), nminIc is the number of minutes
that the breathing system is in idle or non-active modes for the same time period,
and nmintotal = nminOC + nminIC.
Continuous operation + inactivity periods (ﬁne estimate): The calculation of battery life
is performed using a more accurate model. Diﬀerent values of current consumption
are considered in operation and inactivity modes.
In this calculation, the system
can adopt not only two states, but n states. Let c = [c1, c2, . . . , cn] be the average

3.2.2. Results of the Analysis

The previously described items were analyzed for the studies found as a result of the systematic
review. These items were the use of wired or wireless data transmission, the performance of centralized
or remote processing, the speciﬁc station used to carry out processing and the energy autonomy of the
prototypes. They were studied for the wearable category as these elements are limiting in non-contact
sensing systems. However, they are less crucial in environmental systems, since most of them use
wired communications and are connected to a power source.

Table 4 shows a comparison of the approaches found in the state of the art for the wearable
group. The ﬁrst two columns of Table 4 show the speciﬁc studies that used wired and wireless data
transmission, and Figure 20 presents the percentage distribution of the type of transmission. The use
of wired and wireless technologies was similar.

sensing systems.

Figure 21 shows the distribution of wireless technologies used for data transmission. Bluetooth
was the preferred technology, as it is suitable for applications that send point-to-point information
over relatively short distances and require high-speed data transmission. Its main drawback is power
consumption, which could be a limitation for continuous monitoring, as existing studies state that
the battery life is not more than a few hours. However, in view of Table 4, this method seems
suitable for many applications. Wi-Fi, radio frequency, or Zigbee were used in a limited number of
studies [73,96,144,156,159]. Regarding wired transmission, third column of Table 4 shows that USB
communication was the preferred option [74,76,86–88,109,114,118,133,141,158].

30% of studies.

Regarding energy autonomy of systems, the use of energy harvesters was residual [84,104],
which can be due to the fact that studies presented complete systems that included data transmission
and processing modules. These modules are energy demanding, and therefore the use of energy
harvesters can only be used as a complement, but not as the primary power source.

Figure 23. Distribution of battery lives reported in the respiratory monitoring studies.

There were a set of studies focused on minimizing power consumption. They included low power
data transmission technologies. In this regard, Milici et al. used wireless transponders [91] to obtain
autonomy of more than one year, while Mahbub et al. [98] adopted Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband
(IR UWB), which led to an autonomy of about 40 days. In general, battery live is highly dependent on
transmission technology. The works of Bhattacharya et al. [156], Puranik et al. [73], White et al. [96],
Ciobotariu et al. [144], and Mitchell et al. [159] used wearable devices with Wi-Fi [73,96,144,156],
Zigbee [159], or GSM/GPRS [144], with high variability in power consumption.

3.3. Validation Experiments

3.3.1. Items of Analysis

Diﬀerent items were considered to analyze the validation experiments carried out in the studies:

•

Subjects: Almost all studies used volunteers to assess the respiration sensing systems. In this
case, it is required to provide data, such as the number of subjects who participated in the tests
and their main characteristics (age, weight, height, sex, and health status). As breathing studies
generally involve humans, it is mandatory to have the approval of the competent ethical committee
(following the Declaration of Helsinki [258]) to recruit the subjects to participate in the study,
to inform them about the study, and to obtain their consent.

• Activities/positions: This item refers to the speciﬁc activities or positions that volunteers who
participate in the tests are asked to perform as part of the validation experiments. The most
common positions adopted in existing studies are represented in Figure 24 with an example sensor.

• Whether or not motion artifacts are included in the diﬀerent activities.
• Number and values of RRs or volume rates to be tested in the experiments.
• Number of repetitions of the diﬀerent test scenarios.
•

Duration: The designed tests (activities and positions, number of RRs or volume rates, and number
of repetitions) determine the duration of the experiments.
Experiment design: This item refers to the strategies adopted to validate the breathing sensors.
Three main methods have been found in the state of the art (Figure 25):

Figure 24. Common positions/activities to validate the breathing sensors (sitting, standing, lying down,
walking, running, and sleeping). Chest sensor used as an example.

Artiﬁcial validation prototypes: Some studies used artiﬁcial prototypes that emulated human
conditions rather than real volunteers. On the one hand, if the sensor were worn on the chest, diaphragm,
or thorax, a mechanical structure that emulated human respiration could serve for validation. That was
the approach adopted by Padasdao et al. [135]: a motor moved a mechanical chest to the rhythm and
depth of human breathing (Figure 25A). Similarly, the work of Witt et al. [141] also used a mechanical
chest driven by a stepper motor, setting the amplitude and frequency of the movements to simulate
breathing activity. Another set of works [77,94,110,114,146] used machines or custom prototypes
that applied traction and compression movements to simulate human respiration on strain sensors.
On the other hand, if the system is to be worn in the nose or mouth, an artiﬁcial prototype can be
built that emulates the airﬂow associated with respiration. For that, Agcayazi et al. [123] used a
mannequin equipped with an inﬂatable cuﬀ bladder that emulated breathing cycles, which is similar
to the prototype of Koch et al. [90]. For humidity sensors, authors designed controlled humidity
chambers using humidiﬁers and dry air compressors [74] or switches for controlling nitrogen ﬂow
and a motor to control the dispersion of water vapor [97]. Finally, other studies presented artiﬁcial

Validation using artiﬁcial prototypes has the advantage that diﬀerent respiration or volume rates
can be programmed precisely. These theoretical values can be compared with the measurements
obtained with the sensor. Thus, no error can be attributed to the validation method. A typical validation
workﬂow using this method is outlined in Figure 26. In this method, sensor measurements may be

Figure 26. Flow diagram of a typical validation procedure using artiﬁcial prototypes.

Metronome as reference: When humans are involved in the validation experiments, one option is
to use a metronome to set the rate of respiration that subjects must follow during the tests (Figure 25B).
The advantage of this method over artiﬁcial prototypes is that the sensing system is tested with the target
subjects and not with an emulation of a human chest or throat. However, its weak point is that subjects
may not accurately follow the rate of the metronome. Therefore, part of the measurement error can be
attributed to the test design itself rather than to the sensing system. A typical validation workﬂow using
a metronome as a reference is summarized in Figure 27. The measurements recorded by the sensor

(cid:15)Rn×k×p×l×m, which contains the reference
value h. The reference to compare A is matrix B =
breathing parameters set in the metronome for each subject d, repetition e, activity f, position g and
parameter value h. Therefore, B exclusively contains the values of vector z = [z1, z2, . . . zm], which are
the possible settings for the metronome (Figure 27).

Validation against a reference device: The most complete way to validate a new sensor is to
compare its performance with the performance of a reference sensor considered as a gold standard
(Figure 25C). The reference sensor and the sensor under validation must be worn at the same time
to obtain synchronized measurements. Having synchronized measurements allows the sensing
capabilities of both sensors to be compared fairly. The sensor under test should provide measurements
as close as possible to those of the reference sensor. It is important to note that the reference sensor
also has a measurement error. Therefore, this error should be considered in the comparison, as it may
inﬂuence the results. Respiratory values provided by the reference device may diﬀer slightly from
real values. This validation method faces several challenges. First, it is essential to synchronize both
measuring instrument and this synchronization can be diﬃcult. Second, most commercial products do
not provide information on how the ﬁnal breathing parameter (RR or volume parameter) is obtained, so
the comparison of measurements may not be obvious. In addition, most products do not allow selecting
the refresh time window or do not even provide information about the length of this window, so it is
not possible to know the set of measurements used to calculate the output respiration values. Figure 27
shows a typical block diagram of the validation method when using a reference device. The results of
(cid:15)Rn×k×p×l×m, which contain the
(cid:15)Rn×k×p×l×m and C =
this validation are matrices A =
measured values for each subject d, repetition e, activity f, position g, and parameter h for the sensor
under evaluation and for the reference sensor, respectively.

3.3.2. Results of the Analysis

Table 5 presents the results of the analysis of diﬀerent items of the validation experiments for both
wearable and environmental systems. Large diﬀerences among studies were observed in all aspects of
the experiments: protocol, number of subjects, positions, types of breathing, duration, and inclusion of
motion artifacts.

In relation to the number of subjects involved in the tests, 71% of the studies that provided this
data included 10 subjects or less. Only 13% of the studies included more than 20 subjects [7,10,19,64,81,
132,135,147,173,175,211,232]. There were also a considerable number of studies (53) that did not even
provide this information. A part of them did not use subjects for sensor validation.

Regarding the duration of the experiments, most of the studies carried out short experiments of a
few minutes. In fact, 58% of the studies performed tests of less than 5 minutes [69,70,81,86–88,96,100,
102,104,111,125,136,161,163,165,171–174,193,195,196,200,212,215,221,228,229,232]. Most of the works that
conducted longer tests included sleep studies [7,17,53,60,115,146,148,164,165,169,173,192,198,205,211,220,223].
Twenty-six studies reported that motion artifacts were considered during testing. They showed that
the inclusion of motion artifacts in experiments greatly influenced sensor performance [2,9,17,53,61,62,
66–68,81,108,109,117,119,131,132,135,147,157,178,187,190,196,205,210,221,225]. In relation to the activities
or positions considered in the experiments, lying down and sitting were the most tested positions.
Other positions or activities, like standing, walking, moving, or running, were used in a minority of
studies [2,17,21,61,62,66–68,77,79,81,91,94,101–103,108,110,111,115,118,119,124,129,131,132,135,146–149,177,
178,188,205,214,233,235]. Most of the studies that provided information on activities considered more
than one position [2,6,9,17,21,52,53,61,62,66–68,77,79,85–88,94,102,108,110,115,118,119,124,129,131–133,135,
146–148,157,164,165,169,171,177,178,187,196,198,205,210,211,213,214,220,221,223,225,233,235].
It was also
common to test different values of the respiration parameter (for example, RRs from 10 to 22.5 bpm in the
study of Vanegas et al. [254]).

In relation to the validation protocol, Figure 28 shows the distribution of the analyzed studies in
the three categories introduced in Section 3.3.2: validation with an artiﬁcial prototype, metronome
as reference and validation against a reference device. A new category was created to cover studies
that performed informal validation. It was called “human observation”, since an expert provided
a value of the breathing parameter from direct observation of the signals recorded by the sensors.
Figure 28 shows that validation using a reference device was the predominant approach (adopted by
67% of the studies that performed validation), followed by the use of an artiﬁcial validation prototype

(10%) [69,74,77,90,93,97,110,114,116,119,123,135,141,146,150,226]. It is also worth noting that 53 studies
presented the sensing systems without providing evidence of their validation.

3.4. Sensor Measurement Processing

3.4.1. Items of Analysis

This category includes the following items: performance evaluation, software used for the analysis,

and processing algorithm. This section describes them in detail.

Performance Evaluation

The evaluation of sensor performance can be done using several ﬁgures of merit, such as absolute
error, relative/percentage error, root mean square error, correlation factor, Bland-Altman plot, calculation
of accuracies, or linear regression.

Absolute error (∆): Diﬀerence between the value measured by the sensor under test (x) and the

reference value (y). It is calculated according to Equation (11).

∆ = x − y.

(11)

It is more common to provide the mean absolute error (MAE) as the mean of the absolute value of

all absolute errors:

where n is the number of measurements obtained from the sensor under test, xi the values of those
measurements, and yi the reference values associated with those measurements for the “artiﬁcial
validation prototype” method and the “metronome as reference” method or the measurements of the
reference device for the “validation against a reference device” method.

Relative error (RE): Absolute error of the breathing sensor under test (∆) divided by its reference
(true) value (y). Thus, it provides an error value relative to the size of the breathing parameter being
measured. It can be obtained according to Equation (13). The mean of the relative errors (MRE) can be
obtained using Equation (14).

where n, xi, and yi are the same parameters as for the MAE.

If the relative error is expressed as a percentage, it is called the percentage error, although many

authors also provide the relative error in percentage.

Root mean square error (RMSE): In respiration sensing studies, it is also used to compare the
diﬀerence between the values measured by the sensor under analysis and the reference results. It is the
root mean of these diﬀerences and can be obtained according to Equation (15).

Correlation factor: It provides a measure of the relationships between the measurements taken
by the respiration sensor under test and the reference data. There are diﬀerent ways to calculate this
correlation factor. Pearson correlation factor is one of most extended (Equation (16)).

where n, xi, and yi are the same parameters as for the MAE. A correlation factor of 1 means maximum
agreement between measured and reference data (optimal case), while a factor of 0 means that there is
no relationship between the datasets.

Bland-Altman analysis: It is a graphical method to compare the measurements from the breathing
sensor under test with the reference breathing values. A scatter diagram is drawn with the horizontal

) and the vertical
axis representing the mean between measured values and reference values (
axis representing the diﬀerence between those values (xi
− yi). In addition, a horizontal line is included
in the plot with the mean value of all diﬀerences. Two more horizontal lines (one upper and one lower)
are plotted representing the limits of agreement (±1.96 times the standard deviation of the diﬀerences).
The Bland-Altman plot is useful to show relationships between the magnitude of the breathing
parameter and the diﬀerences between measured values. It may also help to identify systematic
errors in measurements or to detect outliers, among others. This method is especially suitable for the
validation method in which the sensor under evaluation is compared to a reference device.

Accuracy: It is the proportion of true results with respect to the total number of samples [259].
It can be used in studies of respiration sensors that identify breathing patterns within a given set of k
possible patterns. It can also be applied to studies that determine the value of a breathing parameter
within a discrete set of k possible values. Let x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn] be the values of the n measurements
taken by a respiration sensing system or the n labels of the breathing patterns recognized by the system.
Suppose that, from the n diﬀerent samples, m samples are correctly identiﬁed or measured, since they

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

belong to the correct class of the k possible classes. Therefore, (n-m) samples are not classiﬁed correctly.
The accuracy of the breathing system can be obtained as:

Accuracy (%) =

·100.

(17)

Linear regression: It models the relationship between the values measured by the respiration
sensing system under test (dependent variable) and the reference measurements (independent variable)
by ﬁtting a linear equation. The equation to ﬁt has the form of y = a + bx, where y is the dependent
variable, x is the independent variable, b is the slope of the line, and a is the intercept (value of yi
when xi = 0). This linear ﬁtting is performed using x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn], which is the set of n reference
values of the breathing parameter, and y = [y1, y2, . . . , yn], which is the set of n values of the parameter
measured by the sensing system under evaluation. In these conditions, the values of each xi and yi
should be as close as possible ∀i ∈ [1..n]. This means that, if the match between the reference values
and the measured values was perfect, the linear model should be a line with and intercept of 0 and a
slope of 1.

In addition, the coeﬃcient of determination r2 could also be calculated to obtain what percentage
of the variation in the values measured by the sensing system are predictable from the variation of the
reference values according to Equation (18).

r2 = 1 − SEres
SEy

(18)

i=1(yi

where SEy = (cid:80)n
− y)2 is the sum of the squares of the diﬀerence of each measured value yi with
respect to the mean value of all measurements y, and SEres = (cid:80)n
− (a + bxi)) is the sum of the
squares of the diﬀerence of each measured value yi with respect to the value predicted by the model.
If SEres is small, it means that the line is a good ﬁt, and r2 will be close to 1. Otherwise, if SEres is large,
it means that the diﬀerence between the measured values yi and the line is large, and r2 will be close to
0 (bad linear ﬁt). If the breathing system measured exactly the same values as the reference system,
SEres would be zero and r2 would be 1, which would be the ideal case.

Analysis Software

The most common tools used to analyze the measurements recorded by the sensors are:

• MATLAB: Popular numerical computing environment and programming language that is suitable
for the implementation of algorithms, matrix operations, or data plotting, among others.
Labview: System engineering software for applications that require testing, measurements, control,
fast hardware access, and data information.

•

• Others: An extensive set of tools has been used in existing studies, such as Python (high-level,
programming language specially focused on facilitating code readability), R (free software
environment and programming language for statistical computing [260]), C# (general-purpose
programming language developed by Microsoft [261]), C (general-purpose programming language
that supports structured programming), OpenCV (open source software library for computer vision
and machine learning [262]), Blynk (Internet of Things platform), Kubios HRV (heart rate variability
analysis software for professionals and scientists), Audacity (free open-source audio software),
Kinect SDK (suitable for developing gesture or voice recognition applications, using Kinect
sensor technology [263]), LabChart (physiological data analysis and acquisition software [264]),
Acqknowledge (software to measure, transform, replay and analyze data [265]), mobile/Android
(mobile operating system), LabWindows/CVI (software development environment specially
focused on measurement applications [266]), microcontroller/microprocessor (suitable if the
processing is not done in any external software, but directly in the same microprocessor or

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

microcontroller that controls the sensor), or custom applications (PC applications in which the
native source could not be accurately determined).

Processing Algorithm

A broad set of algorithms has been used to process measurements from respiration sensors such
as peak detection, maximum-minimum detection, detection of zero-crossings, threshold detection,
frequency analysis, wavelet transform, or Kalman ﬁlter, among others. They are brieﬂy described in
this subsection.

Peak detection: It is based on the detection of peaks in the signals registered by the sensing
system (Figure 29). If no restriction is imposed regarding peak prominence, a peak can be calculated
on a signal x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn] according to Equation (19), where n is the number of samples in the
signal. However, this method is extremely sensitive to noise and ﬂuctuations (Figure 29A). To improve
detection, it is possible to set a minimum surrounding number of samples (p) in which the values must
be below the peak value (Equation (20)) to accept the detected peak (Figure 29B). Another option is to
impose a strictly increasing slope on the p samples preceding the peak and/or a strictly descending
slope on the p samples after the peak (Figure 29C), according to Equation (21).

(21)

The peak detection method to process respiration signals has several important parameters that
determine the number of detected peaks. Peaks selected according to Equations (19), (20), or (21) can be
classiﬁed according to the prominence of the peak, discarding those peaks that are below a threshold
value to avoid the eﬀect of noise and ﬂuctuations. Peak prominence can be deﬁned as the vertical
distance between the closest local minima (in horizontal direction) and the peak, although there are
other possible deﬁnitions [267]. Let y = [y1, y2, . . . , yn] be a vector containing the magnitude of all
local minima of signal x, and b = [b1, b2, . . . , bn] the position (horizontal value) of the local minima y.
If ai is the position of peak i, and bk is an element of b that satisﬁes that bk = min|b − ai| (the position
of the local minima closest to i), then, a peak i will only be accepted if its prominence is above a set
threshold (PP),

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < PP (Figure 29D).

− yk

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xi

Another parameter that may be used to determine the number of peaks is the distance among
them. Breathing signals are low frequency (usually less than 25 bpm [254]); therefore, a threshold
(TD) is generally established to discard those peaks that do not diﬀer by, at least, TD from another
previously detected peak (Figure 29E). Let c =
be the position of the q peaks detected
in a signal. A new peak candidate i, with position on the horizontal axis di, will only be accepted if
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)di

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < TD , ∀j ∈ Z : j ∈ [1, q].
It is also common to discard peaks that do not reach a certain level TL (xi

Maximum-minimum detection: A popular processing technique is to identify maximum and/or
minimum points in the breathing signals (x). Massaroni et al. [103] used the maximum and minimum
values to obtain the respiratory period (Tr), as well as inspiratory (Ti) and expiratory (Te) time.
The process for detecting maximum and minimum points is similar to peak detection.

Zero-crossings: Technique based on the detection of the crossings of a breathing signal by a “zero”
level taken as a reference. Given a respiration signal composed of n values x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn], a new
zero crossing at the i value is detected when inequality (22) is satisﬁed.

One of the challenges of this method is to ﬁnd the “zero” level taken as a reference to detect the
crossing. One possible option is to detect the maximum and minimum values in a speciﬁc window
and obtain the “zero” level as the mean of those values (max(x) + min(x))/2. However, this method
is sensitive to outliers (Figure 30A). A possible solution is to take the median of x as the “zero” level

They are briefly described in this subsection. Peak detection: It is based on the detection of peaks in the signals registered by the sensing system (Figure 29). If no restriction is imposed regarding peak prominence, a peak can be calculated on a signal (cid:1876)=[(cid:1876)(cid:2869),(cid:1876)(cid:2870),…,(cid:1876)(cid:3041)] according to Equation (19), where n is the number of samples in the signal. However, this method is extremely sensitive to noise and fluctuations (Figure 29A). To improve detection, it is possible to set a minimum surrounding number of samples (p) in which the values must be below the peak value (Equation (20)) to accept the detected peak (Figure 29B). Another option is to impose a strictly increasing slope on the p samples preceding the peak and/or a strictly descending slope on the p samples after the peak (Figure 29C), according to Equation (21).

(Figure 30A). Another option is to remove 10–20% of the largest and smallest values of x, obtaining
a subset of values y ⊆ x. Then, the “zero” level can be calculated as the mean of the maximum and
minimum values of y.

Sensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW 42 of 89  This technique is also sensitive to noise since the number of zero-crossings may increase in noisy signals. Figure 30D shows how noise is confused with multiple crossings at the “zero” level in a breathing signal. This can be avoided by defining a minimum distance in the horizontal direction (TD). Let (cid:1878)=(cid:3427)(cid:1878)(cid:2869),(cid:1878)(cid:2870),…,(cid:1878)(cid:3044)(cid:3431) be the positions in the horizontal axis of q detected “zero-crossings”; then, a new “zero-crossing” i with position di will only be considered if (cid:3627)(cid:1856)(cid:3036)−(cid:1878)(cid:3037)(cid:3627)<(cid:1846)(cid:1830) ,∀(cid:1862)∈ℤ:(cid:1862)∈[1,(cid:1869)].  Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

The “zero-crossings” technique is also aﬀected by trends or biases in the measurements. Trends
may be due to movement of the sensing element or movement of the subject.
It is a common
phenomenon, especially in belt-attached breathing sensors. Figure 30B shows a real breathing signal
with trends (blue curve) from a public dataset [254]. If the “zero” level is calculated on a signal with
trends, many crossings may go undetected since the same “zero” level is not a valid reference for the
entire signal. To solve this problem, it is possible to eliminate trends in the signal by subtracting the
bias (Figure 30B, orange signal). Another option could be to split the signal into shorter windows and
calculate a diﬀerent “zero” level for each window (Figure 30C).

This technique is also sensitive to noise since the number of zero-crossings may increase in noisy
signals. Figure 30D shows how noise is confused with multiple crossings at the “zero” level in a
breathing signal. This can be avoided by deﬁning a minimum distance in the horizontal direction (TD).
Let z =
be the positions in the horizontal axis of q detected “zero-crossings”; then, a new

Threshold detection: This technique is similar to “peak detection”, “maximum-minimum
detection” or “zero-crossing detection”. In this case, the level to detect is not a characteristic point of
the curve but a certain threshold value. The same analysis performed for the previous categories could
be applied to this method.

Frequency analysis: This category includes diﬀerent techniques that make use of frequency
information to obtain respiration parameters. The most common approach is to use the well-known
Fourier Transform (FT). Several studies detected peaks in the spectrum of respiration signals or in
their power spectral density (PSD) to obtain the breathing parameters. This method depends on the
time window (Figure 31A). To provide meaningful data, long time windows are desirable. However,
this limits refresh time of the system. A compromise between accuracy and refresh time is required.
Figure 31A shows a breathing signal and its spectra obtained with the FT for diﬀerent refresh time
windows. The example respiration signal has a frequency of 0.33 Hz (20 bpm) and a sampling frequency
of 50 Hz. For a 4-s time window, the maximum available resolution is Fs/N, that is, 0.25 Hz. Figure 31A
shows that the detected frequency is in the range of 0.25–0.5 Hz. This resolution is 0.125 Hz for the 8-s
time window (frequency detected in the 0.25–0.375 Hz range) and 0.0625 Hz for the 16-s time window
(frequency detected in the 0.3125–0.344 Hz range). It can be seen that the wider the time window,
the more accurate results are obtained using this method. However, wide time windows make it
diﬃcult to apply respiration monitoring systems to critical scenarios where instantaneous values must
be provided.

This transform is also sensitive to noise ﬂuctuations. Noise ﬂuctuations are generally of a much
higher frequency than breathing signals. Therefore, it is common to pre-ﬁlter the signals to remove
frequencies that exceed those of breathing activities. Figure 31B shows the frequency spectrum of a
real respiration signal without ﬁltering and with digital low-pass ﬁltering. It can be seen that the peak
of the respiration frequency (0.33 Hz) is more separated from the rest of the spectrum values in the
ﬁltered signal (7 units for the ﬁltered signal and 5 for the unﬁltered signal). If noise levels increased,
it would even be diﬃcult to distinguish the peak associated with the respiration frequency.

On the other hand, low frequency signal ﬂuctuations may appear due to movements in the sensing
device or movements of subjects if breathing is measured during dynamic activities, such as walking.
These ﬂuctuations must be treated to provide accurate results. They can be mathematically modeled
according to Equation (23).

of a real breathing signal with low frequency ﬂuctuations. Those frequency ﬂuctuations can lead to
peaks at very low frequency values of the spectrum. As low-pass ﬁlters are generally applied, those
frequencies would not be removed and could therefore be confused with the respiration parameter,
which is also low frequency.

Sudden movements of subjects may also cause ﬂuctuations in signals, which can aﬀect the
measurements. Figure 31D shows an example of a real respiration signal with ﬂuctuations due to
movements during acquisition tests. The bottom of Figure 31D shows its spectrum with a peak in the
respiration frequency and other lower peaks (in red) at close frequencies due to signal ﬂuctuations.

Other studies have also obtained breathing parameters from frequency using frequency modulation

(FM) or amplitude modulation (AM).

Wavelet transform: It is used to decompose the breathing signal in such a way that a new
representation can be obtained that allows a better detection of respiration peaks or crossings. It has
been used in the continuous or in the discrete form [268]. In the continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
a comparison is made between the respiration signal and an analyzing wavelet ψ. The wavelet is
shifted by applying a dilation factor (b) and is compressed or stretched by applying a scale factor (a).
Therefore, the CWT can be calculated according to Equation (24).

CWT(a, b) =

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

x(t)ψ∗
ab

(t)dt,

(24)

where x(t) is the breathing signal under analysis, and ∗ denotes the complex conjugate [269]. The scale
factor (a) has an inverse relationship with the frequency (the higher the value of a, the lower the
frequency, and vice versa). The dilation factor (b) allows delaying (or advancing) the wavelet onset.
Therefore, it contains time information. In this way, the CWT can provide a kind of time-frequency
representation where high frequency resolution is obtained for low frequencies and high time resolution
is obtained for high frequencies. This is shown in Figure 32A where a real respiration signal is processed
with the CWT. The time-frequency representation of the processed signal is shown in Figure 32A (right).
It can be seen that a low frequency value around 0.33 Hz is identiﬁed with high resolution in frequency
but low resolution in time. In the example respiration signal, the frequency remains fairly constant
around the value of 0.33 Hz.

A variant of the WT is the multiresolution analysis (MRA) [269]. The MRA represents the
voltage signal at diﬀerent resolution levels by progressively analyzing the breathing signals into ﬁner
octave bands (Figure 32B). For that, the original signal is convolved with high and low pass ﬁlters
that represent the prototype wavelet. The outputs of the low pass ﬁlter are called “approximation
coeﬃcients”, while the outputs of the high pass ﬁlter are called “detail coeﬃcients”. Approximation
coeﬃcients are down-sampled by a factor of 2 and are again subjected to high-pass and low-pass
ﬁltering, obtaining a new set of “detail” and “approximation” coeﬃcients. This process is repeated
iteratively, resulting in diﬀerent resolution levels. For a given decomposition level n, the detail
coeﬃcients contain information on a particular set of frequencies (from fs/2n to fs/2n+1), with fs being
the sampling frequency. Regarding the “approximation coeﬃcients” of the same decomposition level,
they contain low-frequency information in the range fs/2n+1 − 0 Hz. The number of decomposition
levels of the MRA depends on the speciﬁc breathing signal, so the band of the respiration frequencies
can be correctly identiﬁed. It is aﬀected by the sampling frequency of the system. This decomposition
process is explained graphically in Figure 32B. The original respiration signal (x) can be reconstructed
from its detail and approximation coeﬃcients as follows:

x =

l(cid:88)

j=1

Dj + Al,

(25)

where l is the number of decomposition levels. Figure 32B also shows an example of this technique
applied to a breathing signal with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz. Six decomposition levels were

selected to obtain ﬁve sets of detail coeﬃcients in the ranges 25–12.5 Hz, 12.5–6.25 Hz, 6.25–3.125 Hz,
3.125–1.563 Hz, 1.563–0.781 Hz and one set of approximation coeﬃcients in the range 0.781–0 Hz.
The ﬁrst and third levels of detail coeﬃcients and the sixth level of approximation coeﬃcients were
represented in Figure 32B as an example. In this case, the level of interest was the sixth (approximation
coeﬃcients) since breathing signals are of low frequency. The Fourier Transform was performed on the
coeﬃcients of the sixth level, obtaining a clear peak at the frequency of 0.33 Hz, which matches the
breathing frequency of the sample respiration signal (20 bpm).

In the work of Scalise et al. [232], the signal was decomposed into 12 levels and level 11 was
considered to obtain the RR. Guo et al. [166] performed a 4-level decomposition, selecting level 3
to calculate the RR. Therefore, the wavelet transform is used to obtain the respiration signals in the
desired frequency band.

Kalman ﬁlter: This technique has been used by several studies as a sensor fusion method. Thus,
it is not a method to extract breathing parameters but to fuse measurements from diﬀerent sensors.
When multiple respiration sensors are available, the measurements they provide are not exactly the
same. Furthermore, measurements always contain noise. The Kalman ﬁlter is used to provide a ﬁnal
value based on the measurements of the diﬀerent sensors, the model of variation of the breathing
parameter, the noise model of the sensors, and the variation model [270]. Figure 33 shows an overview
of the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm adapted to the fusion of breathing sensors.

Figure 33. Kalman ﬁlter algorithm for the fusion of diﬀerent respiration sensors.

The Kalman ﬁlter has two distinct phases: prediction and update. The prediction phase estimates
the state (breathing parameter) in the current time step using the state estimate from the previous time
step (previous breathing parameter). The breathing parameter predicted in this phase is called the
−
“a priori” state estimate ˆx
k and is obtained according to Equation (26).

where ˆxk−1 is the state estimate in the previous state, in this case the previous breathing parameter

the next transition. As breathing does not vary much in the short term [102], a common approach is to
−
deﬁne A as an identity matrix, so the “a priori” state estimate ˆx
k is equal to the previous state ˆxk−1.

the covariance in the previous transition Pk−1, and Q. Q is the covariance of the process noise (the noise

distribution with zero mean and covariance Qk(∼ N(0, Q)). Although A and Q can vary at each time

Kalman filter: This technique has been used by several studies as a sensor fusion method. Thus, it is not a method to extract breathing parameters but to fuse measurements from different sensors. When multiple respiration sensors are available, the measurements they provide are not exactly the same. Furthermore, measurements always contain noise. The Kalman filter is used to provide a final value based on the measurements of the different sensors, the model of variation of the breathing parameter, the noise model of the sensors, and the variation model [270]. Figure 33 shows an overview of the Kalman filter algorithm adapted to the fusion of breathing sensors.  Figure 33. Kalman filter algorithm for the fusion of different respiration sensors. The Kalman filter has two distinct phases: prediction and update. The prediction phase estimates the state (breathing parameter) in the current time step using the state estimate from the previous time step (previous breathing parameter). The breathing parameter predicted in this phase is called the “a priori” state estimate (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879) and is obtained according to Equation (26). (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)=(cid:1827)(cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869), (26)where (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) is the state estimate in the previous state, in this case the previous breathing parameter estimated, and A is the state transition model. Matrix A represents the expected evolution of (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) for the next transition. As breathing does not vary much in the short term [102], a common approach is to define A as an identity matrix, so the “a priori” state estimate (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879) is equal to the previous state (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869). If respiration is not expected to be constant in the short term, A should contain the linear variation model. The “a priori” estimate covariance (cid:1842)(cid:3038)(cid:2879) (Equation (27)), which is a measure of the accuracy of the “a priori” state estimate (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879), must also be predicted. It depends on the transition model A, the value of the covariance in the previous transition (cid:1842)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869), and Q. Q is the covariance of the process noise (the noise of (cid:1876)(cid:3548)(cid:3038)(cid:2879) prediction model). In order to apply the Kalman filter, the process noise must follow a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance Qk(~(cid:1840)(0,(cid:1843))). Although A and Q can vary at each time step k, it is common for them to take a constant value. Many methods exist to determine Q. In the breathing system presented by Yoon et al. [131] Q was a diagonal matrix (which is a common approach) of the order of 10−4. (cid:1842)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)=(cid:1827)(cid:1842)(cid:3038)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:1827)(cid:3021)+(cid:1843).

This gain depends on the “a priori” estimate covariance P
H is the observation model that relates the measurements taken by the sensors yk to the state space
xk (breathing parameter), as follows yk = H ˆxk. It is common that previous techniques introduced
in this section (peak detection, maximum-minimum detection, zero-crossings, threshold detection,
frequency analysis, or wavelet transform) are used to directly estimate the respiration parameter from
the measurements. In that case, the measurement space and the state space are the same. Thus, H could
simply be the identity matrix. If the respiration parameter (RR, for example) were not provided directly
as a result of the measurements, and other parameters were given instead (such as the number of
peaks, zero-crossings, etc.), matrix H would contain the equations to calculate the breathing parameter
from those values. Those equations were previously introduced in this section.

R is the covariance of the observation noise (the noise associated with the measurements yk).
The observation noise should also follow a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance R
(~N(0,R)). Although H and R can vary at each time step k, it is common that they adopt a constant value.
In the update phase, the covariance is also updated to obtain the “a posteriori” estimate covariance

Pk according to Equation (30).

As a result of the update phase, the ﬁnal breathing parameter ˆxk is estimated, which is the output
of this algorithm. However, the Kalman ﬁlter is an iterative method that recalculates ˆxk at each time
step. Therefore, the “a posteriori” state estimate ˆxk at the current time step will be the previous state
estimate ˆxk−1 at the next time step. The same happens with the covariance since the “a posteriori”
estimate covariance Pk at the current time step will be the previous estimate covariance Pk−1 at the next
time step. In this way, the algorithm can start a new prediction process again (Figure 33). The whole
process is repeated indeﬁnitely. The output of the system at each transition is the “a posteriori” estimate
of the respiration parameters ˆxk.

3.4.2. Results of the Analysis

Table 6 presents the results of the analysis for the wearable studies and Table 7 shows the results
of the environmental studies. The second column of each table includes the speciﬁc data processing
techniques used in each study. Figure 34 represents the number of works that use the diﬀerent
processing methods for wearable and environmental studies. The category “custom algorithm” was
added to refer to processing algorithms that cannot be classiﬁed in any other group, as they are speciﬁc
to the sensor used for respiration monitoring. It can be seen that “peak detection” in respiration
signals and “frequency analysis” using the Fourier Transform were some of the most widely used

methods by both wearable and environmental studies. The sum of the percentages of use of techniques
based on the detection of levels in their diﬀerent forms (peaks, maximum and minimum values, zero
crossings, or thresholds) was 42% for the wearable category and 33% for the environmental systems.
In the environmental category, the variability in data processing methods was much greater than in
the wearable category, as a large number of studies applied “custom algorithms”. The use of wavelet
decomposition or the Kalman ﬁlter was residual [102,131,165,166,193,212,232].

Figure 34. Number of studies using diﬀerent processing algorithms for the wearable (left) and
environmental (right) categories.

Figure 35 shows the ﬁgures of merit used to provide a value of sensor performance for the wearable
and environmental studies. The categories “graphical comparison” and “graphical monitoring”,
which could be considered as informal metrics, were added to the list of evaluation metrics of
Section 3.4.1. The category “graphical comparison” refers to studies that visually compared the
performance of the sensing system under evaluation with a reference system, but did not use an
objective metric. The category “graphical monitoring” indicates that measurements from sensors were
plotted, but no formal metric was calculated and no quantitative comparison was made. Figure 35 shows
that “absolute error”, “relative/percentage error”, “Bland-Altman plot”, and “correlation coeﬃcient”
were the preferred formal metrics for wearable and environmental systems. The use of “root mean
square error” [48,52,95,107,115,117,147,164,170,171,187,198], “linear regression” [68,161,167,183,209],
and “accuracy” [7,76,133,161,179,190,193,207,216] was limited. Furthermore, the percentage of studies
that provided an “informal” ﬁgure of merit was much higher for the wearable category (45%) than
for the environmental group (17%). Therefore, a stronger assessment can be seen in environmental
studies. In general, validation results show low error values and a high correlation with reference
devices. The details for the diﬀerent studies are included in the fourth column of Tables 5 and 6.
Fifty-two% of the studies that used relative or percentage errors provided a value less than 5%,
while only 12% reported a value greater than 10%. Correlation coeﬃcients greater than 0.95 were
provided by 46% of the studies [19,52,61,112,126,149,176,180,208,215,222,228,232]. Regarding absolute
error, 78% of the studies that calculated the RR as the breathing parameter provided a value less
than 2 bpm [5,19,64,115,124,132,135,172,175–177,182,189,195,201,207,218,224]. No study reported an
absolute error value greater than 4 bpm. In relation to the Bland-Altman analysis, the mean of the
diﬀerences was less than 0.2 bpm in 49% of the studies that provided data on this metric [48,66,68,69,
78,94,95,112,115,126,167,170,172,180,195,200,210,228].

Regarding the tools for measurement processing, Figure 36 shows the distribution of use of the
diﬀerent tools for the wearable and environmental respiration monitoring systems. MATLAB was
the preferred software for both types of systems, since it was adopted by half of the studies, while NI
Labview was the second most used tool as it appeared in 20–30% of the works [2,3,19,63,71,85–88,127,
129,131,138,142,146,153,163,201,218–220,223,225]. The rest of the tools relied heavily on the speciﬁc
sensor used to capture the data. For instance, Audacity, as a sound processing tool, could only be
used in microphone-based respiration monitoring [162]; OpenCV, as a computer vision library, was
suitable for respiration monitoring through images [187,216]. Therefore, the use of the rest of the tools
was residual.

Figure 35 shows the figures of merit used to provide a value of sensor performance for the wearable and environmental studies. The categories “graphical comparison” and “graphical monitoring”, which could be considered as informal metrics, were added to the list of evaluation metrics of Section 3.4.1. The category “graphical comparison” refers to studies that visually compared the performance of the sensing system under evaluation with a reference system, but did not use an objective metric. The category “graphical monitoring” indicates that measurements from sensors were plotted, but no formal metric was calculated and no quantitative comparison was made. Figure 35 shows that “absolute error”, “relative/percentage error”, “Bland-Altman plot”, and “correlation coefficient” were the preferred formal metrics for wearable and environmental systems. The use of “root mean square error” [48,52,95,107,115,117,147,164,170,171,187,198], “linear regression” [68,161,167,183,209], and “accuracy” [7,76,133,161,179,190,193,207,216] was limited. Furthermore, the percentage of studies that provided an “informal” figure of merit was much higher for the wearable category (45%) than for the environmental group (17%). Therefore, a stronger assessment can be seen in environmental studies. In general, validation results show low error values and a high correlation with reference devices. The details for the different studies are included in the fourth column of Tables 5 and 6. Fifty-two% of the studies that used relative or percentage errors provided a value less than 5%, while only 12% reported a value greater than 10%. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 were provided by 46% of the studies [19,52,61,112,126,149,176,180,208,215,222,228,232]. Regarding absolute error, 78% of the studies that calculated the RR as the breathing parameter provided a value less than 2 bpm [5,19,64,115,124,132,135,172,175–177,182,189,195,201,207,218,224]. No study reported an absolute error value greater than 4 bpm. In relation to the Bland-Altman analysis, the mean of the differences was less than 0.2 bpm in 49% of the studies that provided data on this metric [48,66,68,69,78,94,95,112,115,126,167,170,172,180,195,200,210,228].

4. Discussion

Respiratory monitoring has been actively investigated in recent years, as can be deduced from
the high number of studies included in this systematic review of the literature. While monitoring
breathing in hospital or controlled environments poses fewer problems, the main research challenge is
to monitor breathing for a long period in the user’s daily environment.

Following the approaches of previous works [24], two diﬀerent sets of systems for respiratory
monitoring were identiﬁed. On the one hand, wearable systems have the advantages that they can
be used in any environment, either indoors or outdoors, are generally easy to install and, in most
cases, inexpensive. However, the level of obtrusiveness can determine the acceptability of this type of
systems. Some sensors, such as those designed to be worn on the face or neck, are more obtrusive.
A set of wearable sensing technologies are less invasive. This may be the case of those that are worn
in the chest, abdomen, arms, or wrist. This might be one of the reasons why the detection of chest
movements is the predominant approach. Another reason could be that chest seems to be the part of
the body that presents the greatest variations in its state as a result of the respiratory activity. However,
most of these technologies require users to wear a belt on the chest or abdomen, electrodes that make
contact with the skin, or tight clothing to detect the movement of the thorax [254]. These restrictions
might cause discomfort in the long term or, in extreme cases, even skin problems. The proposal of
Teichmann et al. [56] is original since the sensor is carried in a pocket of a shirt that does not need
to be tight. This represents an advantage over other approaches, although some users may ﬁnd the
lack of integration into clothing uncomfortable. Future research can go in that direction. A common
drawback of wearable systems is that they are heavily aﬀected by artifacts caused by non-breathing
movements. This leads to larger measurement errors, which can even compromise the viability of
the sensing systems in extreme cases. On the other hand, environmental sensors have the advantages
that they are non-invasive, data transmission can be done with cable communication and battery life
does not limit their operation. However, their scope is restricted to a particular area. Any change
in the environment (for example, the relocation of furniture) can modify the detection capabilities.
Additionally, some technologies, such as computer vision, present privacy concerns, which may aﬀect
user acceptance [271]. Environmental sensors seem suitable for home or hospital applications, but not
for continuous monitoring of moving subjects. In fact, usability is a big challenge in respiratory
monitoring. Several authors have highlighted this fact [10,19,51,52,115,159,187,254]. However, despite
this, we identiﬁed a clear gap in the literature since it was not possible to ﬁnd any usability analysis of
the sensors implemented in the existing studies. Future research should also focus on usability. For that,
well-known usability tests can be applied to evaluate the level of acceptance of technology by its
potential users. For example, the User Acceptance of Information Technology (UTAUT) model [272,273]

Future research should also focus on usability. For that, well-known usability tests can be applied to evaluate the level of Matlab, 20Labview, 8Mobile/ Android App, 2C#, 2AcQknowledge software, 1Labchart, 1R computing environment, 1OpenCV, 2Kinect SDK, 1Custom application, 2Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

may serve. This model was applied previously to evaluate smart wearable devices [274], including
health care [275,276], and m-health devices [277]. Other parameters, such as size or weight, can also
aﬀect the adoption of the technology. These parameters have only been provided in a limited number
of studies [2,3,17,21,49,62,64,68,72,85,93,94,97–99,103,105,108,110,113,114,116,119,120,124,126,135,136,
138,141,143,144,146,148,161]. Future works should also consider size and weight as important factors
in the design of sensing systems, subjecting them to evaluation.

Regarding the type of sensors used for respiratory monitoring, ﬁber optic sensors prevailed in the
wearable category. This may be due to their insensitivity to electromagnetic ﬁelds, their high resistance
to water and corrosion, and their compact size and low weight [125]. This technology also allows
monitoring diﬀerent types of physiological parameters simultaneously [278]. In addition, resistive
sensors and accelerometers were the second and third most widely used technologies. This might be
explained as they are suitable for detecting movement variations, and their design is simpler than other
technologies, such as capacitive, pyroelectric, or piezoelectric sensors, among others. In relation to the
environmental category, most researchers designed radar-based sensors. Cameras were also widely
used. The great development of computer vision technology in recent years [279] makes the detection
of chest movements through video image technically feasible. However, cameras present privacy
concerns, which may be why radar sensors are the preferred non-contact technology. Radar systems
are also small in size, low cost, and simple in structure, which provides advantages in installation and
operation [280]. The researches that decided to integrate the sensors into everyday objects again opted
for ﬁber optic technology and sensors based on the measurement of resistance changes. This could be
due to the advantages of these technologies, which have been mentioned before. However, the use of
non-object-embedded environmental systems was the predominant approach, as they do not require
users to be in permanent contact with an object, increasing system applications.

Comparing the performance of sensors is a challenge. It is diﬃcult to compare the performance
of diﬀerent studies, since there is no standardized test to validate the sensors. Authors designed
customized experiments with great diﬀerences among them. Many aspects were deﬁned diﬀerently:
the type and values of the respiratory parameters considered, the positions of the subjects during
the tests, the number of human participants involved in the experiments, their characteristics, or the
duration of the experiments. Diﬀerences were also found in the inclusion of motion artifacts and
in the mechanical devices that simulated respiration, among others. A consequence of this is that
performances provided by existing studies are not comparable, since they were obtained under diﬀerent
test conditions. Therefore, a future research eﬀort is to design a common evaluation framework.
This framework should include quiet and rapid breathing and diﬀerent postures, such as standing,
lying, or sitting. Experiments should include motion artifacts since they aﬀect sensor performance,
as shown by several studies [53,108,157,158]. Additionally, they should involve a number of users high
enough to obtain signiﬁcant results. In general, the number of subjects participating in existing studies
remains low.

In view of the results shown in Section 3.3.2, it is a fact that existing studies carry out short
experiments to validate the sensors. However, little attention is paid to their long-term behavior.
The eﬀect of temperature, sensor aging, or the characteristics of the carrier subjects (such as height or
weight) on the sensing systems have not been actively explored. A sensor that works well in a laboratory
environment might not work as well in a real setting when used for a long time. If there were errors
in the measurements, this would cause frequent recalibrations of the sensors. Therefore, a research
challenge is to test the behavior of respiratory monitoring systems in more realistic environments.
The declared performances in laboratory or controlled settings are high. The challenge is to prove
that they are equally high in real-world usage. Sensor aging might be a problem in terms of system
performance. However, it is less critical in terms of cost as replacement of sensing parts is generally
aﬀordable due to its typically low price.

Regarding the declared performances, the validation of the sensors should be done considering
reference devices. This is the approach adopted by most of the studies. Other validation methods,

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

55 of 84

such as the use of metronomes or artiﬁcial prototypes, are less common since, unlike reference devices,
they are not well-established systems that can be acquired by the scientiﬁc community to replicate
experiments or compare results. There is less consensus with respect to the ﬁgure of merit used to
determine the accuracy of the sensing systems. The relative, absolute and RMS errors, the slope
of the linear regression line, and the correlation factor have been considered. It is also common to
apply the Bland-Altman analysis [281]. It not only provides information on the diﬀerences between
the measurements of both sensors but also shows the variation of the diﬀerences with respect to the
magnitude of the measurements. In addition, the standard deviation of the diﬀerence is also used to
obtain the upper and lower limits of agreement. The high variability of the ﬁgures of merit makes it
diﬃcult to compare the studies. One issue of respiratory monitoring is that the acceptable margin of
error is not clearly deﬁned and, therefore, it is diﬃcult to determine whether a new sensing system is
in agreement with reference devices. This may be a consequence of the lack of a common experimental
framework, since the margin of error depends on the speciﬁc experiments carried out. For example,
the acceptable error may be diﬀerent for slow or rapid breathing. Ideally, both the mean of diﬀerences
and the limits of agreement in the Bland-Altman analysis should be provided. As complementary
information, it would also be interesting to have the mean absolute or relative errors, or the correlation
factor. This would facilitate comparison of system performance among studies. However, this is not
the most common approach and only a limited number of studies have incorporated it [10,44,57,60,61,
65,78,92,100,109,112,114,122–124,132,163,165–169,176,178,191,196,205,206,211,224,228].

Additionally, the parameter to be sensed varies among studies. The most common breathing
parameter obtained by existing studies is the RR. However, several studies calculate volume parameters,
which are useful for many applications. There are studies that provide both [2,49,52,61,116,122,147],
although the calculation of the volume parameters is a challenge since it depends on the speciﬁc
technology. An approximation for a capacitive textile force sensor can be found in the work of
Hoﬀmann et al. [17]. However, this is still and open research topic. Obtaining an accurate estimate of
volume parameters using the sensing techniques presented in this review is not easy, especially for
wearable systems.

Regarding processing algorithms, it can be concluded that detection of peaks, maximum and
minimum values, thresholds, or zero crossings were eﬀective in determining respiration parameters.
Frequency analysis also provided good results. This aspect seems to have been successfully resolved
in existing studies. The use of other processing techniques is residual, as they generally require
more computing resources, are more complex, and are highly dependent on the speciﬁc design of the
sensing system.

Wired and wireless transmission are used equally, as the type of transmission is usually determined
by the type of sensor. Within wireless systems, Bluetooth was the preferred option. This may be
explained because most sensing systems communicate with a smartphone/tablet or PC that is close to
the sensing unit. In fact, PC processing is the main trend. This can be a consequence of the majority
of studies presenting laboratory prototypes that are far from usable portable systems. In general,
authors do not give much thought to the amount of resources that the processing algorithms use as they
perform centralized oﬄine processing on a PC using numerical computing software, such as MATLAB.
This could compromise the real time operation of the systems when they are running continuously.
Future research eﬀorts should focus on designing suitable processing techniques to run ubiquitously
in real time on the same microprocessor of the sensing unit or on smartphones.

Power consumption is crucial in wearable respiratory monitoring. Most studies did not provide
information on power consumption or battery life.
In addition, there was no consensus on the
measurement procedure and the energy parameters that should be provided. In this context, it is very
diﬃcult to compare the power consumption provided by the diﬀerent studies fairly. For example, battery
life varies greatly depending on factors, such as data transmission procedure (continuous, intermittent,
or without transmission), sensor operating time (non-stop, several hours a day, etc.), monitoring
visualization (real-time display, without visualization, etc.), or the inclusion of the processing of the

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

56 of 84

measurements in the power study, among others. When a study provides the battery life of a respiratory
sensor, not only must the capacity of the particular battery used in the study be provided, but also
other characteristics that aﬀect its performance: depth of discharge, cycle lifetime, or c-rate [282].
It would also be interesting that researchers indicate the power consumption of each component of
the system and not just the total autonomy of the device [98]. This would allow the identiﬁcation
of the critical components and facilitate the comparison of diﬀerent systems. Given that autonomy
is a limiting factor, strategies to reduce power consumption are required [135]. However, only a
few works have implemented them. Several respiratory monitoring studies focused on transmission
technology, since it is usually the most demanding module [91,98]. For example, technologies, such
as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, consume more energy than Impulse Radio Ultra-wideband. Other strategies
adopted were the down-sampling of data to reduce computational load [119]. The limited number of
works that adopted energy saving strategies may be a symptom that researchers are more focused
on validating their sensors than in real-world applications. This can also be inferred from the short
battery life indicated by most studies that include this data (less than 12 h typically). Furthermore,
the use of energy harvesting techniques in respiratory monitoring is another open research question,
since the number of studies that implemented them is still residual [77,84,104,135,240–248,250–253].
Most studies presented laboratory experiments instead of functional prototypes.

An ideal breathing sensor should be mobile, easy to use, imperceptible and immune to body
motion [48,119,135]. Several authors agree that a system that covers all these aspect should be
successfully integrated into clothing [21,59,65,69,84,85,94,103,108,113,119,123,142,143,151]. This is a
consequence of the fact that long-term home monitoring entails direct connection between patient and
system. However, this poses several problems, such as the adaptation of the sensing system to diﬀerent
sizes of clothing, the integration of the energy supply, or the washing of sensors, among others. In fact,
this is an open research question.

5. Conclusions

This paper presents a systematic review on sensors for respiratory monitoring, ﬁlling a gap in the
state of the art since no published reviews analyzing respiratory sensors from a comprehensive point
of view could be found to the best of our knowledge. As a result of several searches, an overwhelming
number of studies was found. They were sorted by relevance and, ﬁnally, 198 studies were obtained to
be examined in detail. They were classiﬁed into two groups: wearable and environmental sensors.
Several aspects were analyzed: sensing techniques, sensors, breathing parameters, sensor location and
size, general system setups, communication protocols, processing stations, energy autonomy, sensor
validation experiments, processing algorithms, performance evaluation, and software used for the
analysis. As a result, detection of chest movements was identiﬁed as the most common technique
using ﬁber optic sensors for the wearable systems and radar sensors for the environmental systems.
The RR was the most common breathing parameter obtained in 68% of the studies. Most of the studies
performed centralized measurement processing on a PC using MATLAB software. Bluetooth was by
far the prevalent communication technology (60% of the wearable studies adopted it), and almost all
wireless respiration sensing systems were battery powered. The most common validation approach
was to use a reference device to perform real tests on real subjects. Furthermore, a high percentage of
studies obtained the breathing parameter after performing frequency analysis or peak detection on the
measurements. Meanwhile, the most common ﬁgures of merit selected to provide evidence on sensor
performance were absolute and relative errors, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coeﬃcients.

This review also identiﬁed future research challenges. One of them is the need to deﬁne a common
framework to validate the sensors, since each author carried out his or her own experiments. This makes
it diﬃcult to compare sensor performances. Similarly, measurements of power consumption were
made under diﬀerent conditions. A common measurement procedure is required to compare sensor
autonomies fairly. There are no long-term evaluations that study the eﬀect of aging, environmental
conditions, or characteristics of the subjects on sensor performance.

Sensors 2020, 20, 5446

57 of 84

Usability tests are also lacking in existing studies. Similarly, the ﬁgure of merit to provide sensor
performance varies from one study to another. The Bland-Altman analysis was identiﬁed as the most
appropriate method to validate the sensors against reference devices. Other research challenges are the
implementation of energy-saving or energy-harvesting strategies, the application of respiratory sensors
to real-world scenarios, or the calculation of volume parameters in the diﬀerent sensing technologies.
All these are remaining research eﬀorts.

Finally, several authors highlighted the integration of respiratory monitoring sensors in clothing
as a promising technology. This is a future research eﬀort, which presents several challenges for a
feasible, long-term, and unobtrusive solution.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, plays a crucial
role in early detection and even prediction of conditions that may aﬀect the wellbeing of the patient.
Sensing vital signs can be categorized into: contact-based techniques and contactless based techniques.
Conventional clinical methods of detecting these vital signs require the use of contact sensors, which
may not be practical for long duration monitoring and less convenient for repeatable measurements.
On the other hand, wireless vital signs detection using radars has the distinct advantage of not
requiring the attachment of electrodes to the subject’s body and hence not constraining the movement
of the person and eliminating the possibility of skin irritation. In addition, it removes the need for
wires and limitation of access to patients, especially for children and the elderly. This paper presents
a thorough review on the traditional methods of monitoring cardio-pulmonary rates as well as the
potential of replacing these systems with radar-based techniques. The paper also highlights the
challenges that radar-based vital signs monitoring methods need to overcome to gain acceptance
in the healthcare ﬁeld. A proof-of-concept of a radar-based vital sign detection system is presented
together with promising measurement results.

Keywords: heart rate; radars; respiration rate; vital signs; sensors

1. Introduction

The four major vital signs are body temperature (BT), heart rate (HR), breath rate (BR) and blood
pressure (BP). They provide almost a complete picture of individuals’ body vital functions and help to
assess their general physical health. The assessment of body temperature is relatively simple, low cost
and does not often require continuous monitoring. On the other hand, detection and monitoring of
breath rate and heart rate usually require complex systems involving sensors and computers that are
physically connected. Breath rate or breath frequency determines the number of respiration cycles
performed by an individual in one minute while the heart rate or pulse rate corresponds to the number
of heart beats per minute. The standard breath rate and pulse rate of a healthy adult individual ranges
between 12–20 breaths per minute and 60–100 beats per minute, respectively [1,2]. For children these
ranges change to 17–40 breaths per minute and 70–190 beats per minute for BR and HR, respectively.
Any abnormality to the standard cardio-pulmonary rates may indicate a sign of physical or mental
stress. There are two main techniques of the cardio-pulmonary vital signs detection: the contact-based
methods and the contactless-based methods using radars.

Monitoring of human cardio-pulmonary rates exhibits a variety of applications from medical
diagnostics to ﬁtness assessment and emotion recognition. Heart and respiration rates monitoring

can be used to predict certain pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, which account for more than
31% of all deaths worldwide [3]. The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS) are two major conditions causing high mortality in both infants and adults.
SIDS is the leading cause of death of infants under 1 year old in the developed world [4]. In 2016, SIDS
accounted for 38% of all sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) in the United States [4]. Furthermore,
a new study conducted in 2018 estimated that nearly a billion people are aﬀected by OSAS around the
world [5], corresponding to 10 times the number previously reported by the World Health Organization
(WHO) in 2007. Therefore, continuous monitoring of infants, elderly or injured patients is necessary,
especially for homecare applications. Monitoring of vital signs is essential in the early detection of
both OSAS [6] and SIDS [7]. Furthermore, it has been proven that both the pulse rate and respiratory
rate are fundamental predictors of cardiac arrest [8]. A study in [8] shows that the diﬀerence in BR
and HR in individuals at risk of cardio-pulmonary arrest and healthy individuals is more signiﬁcant
than the diﬀerence in other vital signs such as BP and BT. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor HR and
BR for diagnosis of this fatal condition. Moreover, vital signs monitoring can be used to monitor
athletes and non-athletes during exercise. Since cardiac health issues can be complex and do not
exhibit any apparent symptoms [9], it is vital to monitor the cardio-respiratory rates in order to
adjust the appropriate intensity of exercise for the body. In addition, exercise-induced dyspnea and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are proven to have strong correlation with BR [10,11].
Finally, vital signs monitoring can be applied in the assessment of physical and psychological stress
of individuals. In [12], the physical conditions of ﬁreﬁghters during work have been examined and
compared to the normal physiological conditions using their vital signs data. Mood disorder and stress
are shown to be related to the respiration rate, heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) [13]. BR was
demonstrated to be related to cognitive load after vital signs measurement experiments were carried
on high-demanding task performers such as pilots, soldiers and surgeons.

In this paper, we review diﬀerent methods used in contact-based (Section 2) and contactless
radar-based (Section 3) cardio-pulmonary signals’ detection and monitoring as well as their challenges in
biomedical applications. Furthermore, state-of-the-art solutions for challenges in vital signs detection
using radars are provided in Section 3 as they are promising technologies to potentially replace
traditional contact-based vital signs sensing. In Section 4, experimental results of a continuous-wave
radar is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of wireless sensing of human vital signs. Section 5
summarizes the review of the two vital signs detection methods as well as future works on the
radar-based vital signs acquisition.

2. Conventional Contact-Based Vital Signs Acquisition

This section reviews some of the major contact-based methods for detecting human respiratory
and cardiac rates. The review highlights the fundamental principles of the various methods as
well as some of their shortcomings. The contact-based methods addressed in this section include
electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, airﬂow sensing, chest-wall mechanical displacement
sensing, blood pressure sensing and sound-based sensing. We will explain each type in the next sections

2.1. Electrocardiography

Electrocardiography is a process of acquiring the electrical activity of the heart resulting from the
action potential generated by heartbeats. It is based on measuring the potential diﬀerence between at
least two points on the body surface of the subject [14]. The signal obtained from an electrocardiography
is called the electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG monitoring systems are crucial for the diagnosis of heart
conditions such as myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia [15]. Even though ECG systems are mainly
used to monitor heart signals, breathing rate can be estimated from the ECG data [16,17]. Called
ECG-derived respiration (EDR), this technique is based on a process named sinus arrhythmia [18].
There are two common ECG systems, namely the 12-lead clinical ECG system and the portable
ambulatory ECG system.

Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

In the 12-lead ECG system, 10 electrodes are attached to the surface of limbs and chest of the
subject, generating 12 groups of signals [19] (Figure 1a). Electrodes denominated by RA (right arm)
and LA (left arm) are usually attached either to the wrist or the upper chest area of the patient. On the
other hand, the right leg (RL) and left leg (LL) electrodes are attached to the leg or the lower peripheral
stomach areas. Data obtained from the leads are processed by a computer and displayed on a screen.
Conventional clinical ECG are directly connected to the signal-processing unit using cables. However,
new-generation clinical ECGs have Bluetooth or ZigBee facilities, eliminating the need for cabling [20].
However, the need to place electrodes on the skin of the patient persists. Even though the 12-lead
ECG system provide more accurate cardiac signal than the portable ambulatory ECG system, its bulky
nature and use of many electrodes and sensors impede its usage outside clinical applications. Despite
its relatively high cost, the traditional clinical ECG require a trained person to operate.

Figure 1. (a) Twelve-lead clinical electrocardiogram (ECG) system; (b) ambulatory ECG system; (c)
representation of ECG signal.

On the other hand, ambulatory ECG systems have typically three leads or fewer and are smaller
in size, as shown in Figure 1b. The bio-potential signals sensed by the electrodes pass through an
analog front end (AFE) unit, where it is subjected to ﬁltering and ampliﬁcation before being processed
by a digital signal processing (DSP) unit. This type of ECG system can be used in domestic settings,
unlike the conventional clinical ECG systems [21]. Ambulatory ECG systems can be designed to have

the sensitivity of the system. Nevertheless, because of its toxic nature, the conductive gels cause skin
irritation of patients [25]. Furthermore, some patients may be allergic to the acrylic adhesive, which

the wet electrodes method is not suitable for long-term and frequent monitoring of patients. Many
recently developed ECG systems use dry capacitive electrodes [18,21,28,29]. Since the dry-electrode

Sensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 37  In the 12-lead ECG system, 10 electrodes are attached to the surface of limbs and chest of the subject, generating 12 groups of signals [19] (Figure 1a). Electrodes denominated by RA (right arm) and LA (left arm) are usually attached either to the wrist or the upper chest area of the patient. On the other hand, the right leg (RL) and left leg (LL) electrodes are attached to the leg or the lower peripheral stomach areas. Data obtained from the leads are processed by a computer and displayed on a screen. Conventional clinical ECG are directly connected to the signal-processing unit using cables. However, new-generation clinical ECGs have Bluetooth or ZigBee facilities, eliminating the need for cabling [20]. However, the need to place electrodes on the skin of the patient persists. Even though the 12-lead ECG system provide more accurate cardiac signal than the portable ambulatory ECG system, its bulky nature and use of many electrodes and sensors impede its usage outside clinical applications. Despite its relatively high cost, the traditional clinical ECG require a trained person to operate. On the other hand, ambulatory ECG systems have typically three leads or fewer and are smaller in size, as shown in Figure 1b. The bio-potential signals sensed by the electrodes pass through an analog front end (AFE) unit, where it is subjected to filtering and amplification before being processed by a digital signal processing (DSP) unit. This type of ECG system can be used in domestic settings, unlike the conventional clinical ECG systems [21]. Ambulatory ECG systems can be designed to have low power and size [22,23], although they are less accurate compared to the clinical ECG systems. A typical ECG waveform is represented in Figure 1c.

wet-electrode counterpart. However, the dry electrodes have high electrode tissue impedance (ETI)
due to poor contact with the skin and are prone to motion artifacts [20]. Moreover, standard placement
of the electrodes must be followed in order to obtain accurate signals [30,31]. Other factors that aﬀect
the accuracy of the ECG signal include the motion artifact (MA) of the lead electrodes and change in
impedance of the electrodes due to the respiration, which causes an amplitude modulation of the ECG
data [32,33]. The inhaling and exhaling process during respiration cause an increase and decrease of
the heart rate, respectively and, hence, produce a frequency modulation in the ECG signal [34] for the
detection of heartbeat. Clinical ECG systems remain the gold standard method of measuring the heart
rate and heart rate variability. Nevertheless, they are bulky and expensive. A relatively cheaper way of
acquiring vital signs involve photoplethysmography, which is discussed next.

2.2. Photoplethysmography

Photoplethysmography is a technique that uses optical means to instantaneously measure the
changes in volume in human tissue [35]. The time-varying signal obtained from photoplethysmography
is referred to as the photoplethysmogram (PPG). At least one light-emitting-diode (LED) in direct contact
with the tissue is used to emit light with wavelengths between 500 nm and 600 nm, corresponding to
the green and yellow regions [36,37]. The green light is widely used for HR acquisition. However,
many photoplethysmography setups use the red and infra-red optical regions for blood oxygen
monitoring [38–40]. A portion of the emitted light is absorbed by human tissue while the other portion
is reﬂected. A photo-detector (PD) is used to record the intensity of the received light. This intensity
changes during the systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle [37]. The PD can be placed either
at the same side of the light emitter or the opposite side, depending on whether the acquisition is in
reﬂectance-mode or transmission-mode [41]. Since the attenuation from the body tissue is high at the
low optical wavelength region, PPG systems employing the green-yellow regions are better used in
reﬂectance-mode operations, whereas transmission-mode operation is preferred for red and infrared
optical signals. However, these two methods diﬀer less in terms of the measurement accuracy of heart
rate or heart rate variability, even though higher accuracy blood oxygen measurement is obtained in
transmission mode. Pulse oximetry uses the transmission-mode because the venous oscillations are
less accentuated in this mode [42] and; hence a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signal is produced.
As represented in Figure 2a, the oximeter probe sensor can be attached to the ﬁnger of the subject or
any other peripheral sites including ears and toes. Since the wavelength of the light is proportional to
the penetration depth, infra-red (IR) light can be used for deep-tissue blood ﬂow measurement. An
AFE is used to improve the signal quality before sending to computer wirelessly or via cabling for
signal processing. The change in blood volume becomes more signiﬁcant in the arteries, as shown in
Figure 2b.

Moreover, the respiration rate can be estimated from the PPG data since breathing causes an
amplitude and frequency modulation of the received signal [34,41], even though the PPG signal is
mainly used to estimate the heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Furthermore, a baseline wander
or direct-current (DC) oﬀset is caused by the respiratory cycles. The reﬂectance mode is often used
in the estimation of breath rate since it is more sensitive to venous pressure during respiration [41].
A typical waveform of the PPG is shown in Figure 2c. The modulation due to breathing can be clearly
seen as well as the pulsatile components of the heartbeat.

human body [37]; (c) description of PPG waveform.

Despite being cost-eﬀective, PPG systems most often produce signals that are aﬀected by several
factors including the measuring site, ambient temperature and the posture of the subject [35,37,43].
In addition, the accuracy of the PPG raw signal can be undermined by the MA of the subject [43].

Many recent works on PPG remote monitoring are based on the use of a camera, which can be
from a cellphone or a laptop [24,44–46]. Called video plethysmography (VPG), this technique uses
ambient light as the emitter source and the camera as the photodetector [32]. The ambient optical
illumination can be natural light or compact ﬂuorescent [44]. The red-green-blue (RGB) components of
the camera are separated and processed using diﬀerent signal-processing methods [44]. Even though
the VPG oﬀers the ability to monitor the heart rate remotely, it can only provide rough value of the
heart rate rather than beat-to-beat plethysmography using the commercial video camera. High quality
video cameras can be used to enhance the cardiovascular signal [45], which makes the overall system
costly. Moreover, the signal quality is related to the size of the region of interest (ROI). The larger the
ROI, the better the quality of signal produced. However, the computation becomes more complex
when the ROI is large (i.e., the whole human face), hence a burden for low computing resources devices
such as smart phones [46].

Breath rate generated from ECG and PPG is obtained from the breath modulation in amplitude
and frequency of the heart signal and therefore is approximate. A more accurate method of acquiring
BR can be done by sensing the breath air components, temperature and humidity. Next, we will discuss
vital signs detection using breath air-sensing methods.

2.3. Air Components-, Temperature- and Humidity-Based Methods

Human breath rate can be measured using characteristics of the inhaled and exhaled air such as

its carbon dioxide (CO2), its humidity and temperature.

2.3.1. Air Components

The level of CO2 contained in the air we breathe diﬀers from inhalation to exhalation. Typically,
the inhaled air contains approximately 0.04% of carbon dioxide while the exhaled air contains around
6% [34]. This diﬀerence in CO2 levels can be measured using chemical sensors to determine the breath

Called video plethysmography (VPG), this technique uses ambient light as the emitter source and the camera as the photodetector [32]. The ambient optical illumination can be natural light or compact fluorescent [44]. The red-green-blue (RGB) components of the camera are separated and processed using different signal-processing methods [44].

Air Components-, Temperature- and Humidity-Based Methods Human breath rate can be measured using characteristics of the inhaled and exhaled air such as its carbon dioxide (CO2), its humidity and temperature. 2.3.1. Air Components The level of CO2 contained in the air we breathe differs from inhalation to exhalation. Typically, the inhaled air contains approximately 0.04% of carbon dioxide while the exhaled air contains around 6% [34]. This difference in CO2 levels can be measured using chemical sensors to determine the breath rate. The most common sensors used are the infrared sensor and the fiber optic sensor, although the former is more popular than the latter. The technique used to determine human breath rate from CO2 level variations between inhaled and exhaled air is called capnography. A capnography system is mainly composed of a CO2 sensor, gas sampling tube and a signal acquisition and processing unit. The setups for CO2 level measurement are depicted in Figure 3a,b.

The setups for CO2 level measurement are depicted in Figure 3a,b. Two main capnography setup
methods are available: the side stream method and the mainstream method [24]. In the side stream
measurement technique, the sensor and the main processing units are placed away from the subject. In
contrast to the side stream setup, the chemical sensor in the mainstream method is located between the
processing unit and the endotracheal tube, which is attached to the facial area of the subject as seen in

The waveform obtained from a capnography is called a capnogram. A typical capnogram has
three diﬀerent phases, namely the inspiration, alveolar and expiration phases as seen in Figure 3c [47].
The expiration, alveolar and beginning of inspiration are denoted by PQ, QR and RS, respectively, while
the latency phase is represented by ST. The angles α and β indicate transition between respective phases.
Despite their insensitivity to the motion artifact of the subject, breath rate measurement based on
capnography is quite uncomfortable for long-term monitoring and can be very sensitive to other gas
components and changes in humidity and temperature of the environment [36].

2.3.2. Air Temperature

The temperature of the inhaled and exhaled air are diﬀerent (i.e., the exhaled air is warmer than
the inhaled one). This diﬀerence can be as high as 15
C [48]. The air temperature-based breath rate
measurement is based on acquiring the temperature variation between the inhaled and the exhaled
air. A temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature of breath air of the subject and convert it
into electrical signal (e.g., voltage or current). The signal is enhanced by an analog interface before
being processed to obtain the breath rate (Figure 4a). Diﬀerent types of transducers are used to convert
the temperature of the airﬂow into an electrical signal. These includes, but not limited to thermistors,
thermocouples, pyroelectric sensors and ﬁber optic sensors.

Thermistors are resistors with resistance non-linearly dependent on temperature [49].
Thermocouples are thermoelectric sensors producing a voltage signal due to the temperature
diﬀerence between two conductors (Seebeck eﬀect) [50]. Breath rate detection using thermistors
and thermocouples is accurate and relatively cheaper. On the other hand, pyroelectric sensors are
based on the production of electric current when the sensor interface is heated by the exhaled air [51].

Breath rate acquisition using pyroelectric sensors has comparable performance with the aforementioned thermistors and thermocouples-based monitoring. Moreover, sensors based on fiber optics are employed in many recent works [53,54]. These sensors are based on the shift in Bragg wavelength due to temperature variation of the airflow [53]. Even though fiber optic sensors are more expensive compared to the thermistors, they provide faster response. Nevertheless, their application is limited to clinical settings due to their bulky size. Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

rate acquisition using pyroelectric sensors has comparable performance with the aforementioned
thermistors and thermocouples-based monitoring. Moreover, sensors based on ﬁber optics are
employed in many recent works [53,54]. These sensors are based on the shift in Bragg wavelength
due to temperature variation of the airﬂow [53]. Even though ﬁber optic sensors are more expensive
compared to the thermistors, they provide faster response. Nevertheless, their application is limited to
clinical settings due to their bulky size.

Figure 4b shows the response of a typical air temperature-based breath rate monitoring using
thermistor sensors.
It resembles a sine wave depicting the increase and decrease in the airﬂow
temperature during respiration. Breath rate monitoring systems using air temperature variation are
simpler and cost eﬀective in general. However, their applications are limited to simple breath rate
detection and do not provide heart rate.

2.3.3. Air Humidity

Similar to the capnography method previously discussed, breath rate can be measured by acquiring
the water vapor level of the inhaled and exhaled air. The related humidity of the inhaled air diﬀers
from that of the exhaled one by approximately 20% to 60% [54]. This diﬀerence in humidity can be
acquired and plotted indicating the instantaneous respiration pattern. The general representation of
air humidity-based breath rate detection systems is depicted in Figure 4a. The sensor in question
is a humidity sensor, which can be of capacitive or resistive types. The capacitive and resistive
sensors change the capacitance and resistance values, respectively, due to exposure to humidity. This
change in capacitance or resistance can be measured and related to the inhaling and exhaling of air.
Other types of sensor including the sensors using nanoparticles [55], nanocomposite [56], ﬁber Bragg
grating (FBG) [57] and surface acoustic wave (SAW) [58] can be used as humidity sensors. However,
monitoring systems using nanocomposites and nanoparticles have relatively slower response time [56].

Like the aforementioned air-based vital sign detection and monitoring systems, the breath rate detection systems employing humidity sensors require the subject to wear a face mask or a tube around the nostril to avoid the corruption of the respiration signal by MAs. As we will see in the next section, vital signs measurement using chest displacement sensing can be non-invasive while providing good accuracy. 2.4. Chest-Wall Mechanical Displacement Sensing and Blood Pressure-Sensing Methods Human breath and heart rates can be measured by sensing the mechanical or physical activities of the heart and lungs at the surface of the body.   Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

next section, vital signs measurement using chest displacement sensing can be non-invasive while
providing good accuracy.

2.4. Chest-Wall Mechanical Displacement Sensing and Blood Pressure-Sensing Methods

Human breath and heart rates can be measured by sensing the mechanical or physical activities of

the heart and lungs at the surface of the body.

2.4.1. Chest-Wall Displacement Sensing

During normal human respiration, the diaphragm contracts and expends along with the
intercostal muscles, allowing air to enter and exit the lungs. These physical activities of the
diaphragm and respiratory muscles result in displacement of the chest that can expand up to
7.37 cm circumferentially [60]. Diﬀerent types of sensor can be used to detect the physical movement
of the chest. Nevertheless, the most common methods of measuring the chest-wall displacement are
based on strain sensing, transthoracic impedance sensing or impedance pneumography and movement
sensing using accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

The strain-sensing method employs resistive, capacitive, inductive and ﬁber-optic sensors to
record the instantaneous change in strain. Piezo-resistive strain sensors employ elements that change
their shape when subjected to a physical displacement. This change in shape results into a change in
their resistance values which are measured using an electronic circuit (Figure 5a). The strain-sensing
elements in piezo-resistive sensors is often referred to as “strain gauge” [61]. The strain gauge can
be of textile with a coated or embedded conductive element [62,63]. Furthermore, capacitive strain
sensors use two diﬀerent electrodes placed opposite to each other around the abdomen of the subject,
as depicted in Figure 5b. The capacitance between the two electrodes is measured using a capacitance
meter [64]. Since the capacitance is related to the permittivity of the dielectric material between the
electrodes as well as their separated distance, the capacitance value of the two electrodes change
during inhaling and exhaling of the subject as the lung air changes the permittivity and the expansion
and contraction of the thorax changes the distance between the electrodes. Although the electrodes
can be ﬂexibly attached to the human body, tightly attached electrodes exhibits better performance in
terms of noise and sensitivity [65]. Furthermore, respiratory rate can be estimated using the change of
alternating current in a magnetic coil during breathing activities [66]. Called respiratory inductive
plethysmography (RIP), this technique uses the alternating current variation in a magnetic coil attached
to the abdomen or thorax of the subject to provide the breathing pattern (Figure 5c). The change
in volume of the magnetic coil during the respiration changes the inductance value of the coil and
hence the alternating current ﬂowing through it which can be measured. RIP systems have been
implemented to monitor sleep apnea [67,68] with good results. However, the motion artifact from the
thorax of the subject may undermine the validity of the breath signal [66]. Lastly, ﬁber-optic sensors
can be used as a strain-based respiration sensor [69] (Figure 5d). FBG sensors can be embedded in
textile [69,70]. These sensors have faster response time and higher sensitivities compared to their
resistive, capacitive and inductive counterparts. Due to their higher sensitivity to small mechanical
movements, they can be employed to detect heartbeat signals [71]. Strain-based respiration sensing
using smart textiles is extensively used in literature to monitor human respiration and for diagnosis of
breath-related diseases [72–75].

inductive sensing and (d) ﬁber-optic sensing.

Moreover, the impedance pneumography consists of measuring the impedance of the thorax,
which is related to the volume of the lungs. Figure 6a represents the measurement setup of an impedance
pneumography. An alternating current (AC) is injected through the skin of the subject using electrodes
attached to the chest area, and the voltage diﬀerence between electrodes is measured [76]. This voltage
diﬀerence is proportional to the injected current and the impedance of the thorax. The number of
electrodes can be 2 or 4, the latter showing more accuracy [76]. The AC frequency is typically high
(about 50 kHz) and the injected current is less than 1 mA. The typical value of thoracic impedance is 500
Ω. This value ﬂuctuates during breathing activities. Transthoracic impedance measurement methods
have been employed in monitoring sleep apnea [77], identifying childhood pneumonia [78] and
monitoring breath rate during exercise [79]. Even though the breath rate acquisition from impedance
pneumography systems are proven to be accurate and do not require tight attachment of sensors to the
body of the subject unlike the strain-based sensing methods, they suﬀer from noise resulting from MA.

Finally, respiratory rate can be detected by measuring the acceleration, the angular velocity and
the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the abdomen during respiration. An accelerometer can be used to convert
the mechanical movement of the abdomen into an electrical signal. The movement of the thorax is
related to the inertial response of the accelerometer. By attaching this electromechanical device to the
upper thorax, it is possible to record the human breathing pattern [80,81]. The measurement results

Furthermore, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope can be used to estimate breath rate by measuring the angular velocity of the thorax during respiration. An insight into the working principle of gyroscopes can be found in [84]. As gyroscopes can only determine rotational movement of the thorax, any drift in their three-dimensional (3D) position can result in errors [85] in breath rate detection. Therefore, they are often used in conjunction with accelerometers to provide more accurate signals [86]. Furthermore, movements from breathing activities can be detected by measuring the magnetic field strength around the chest area using a magnetometer. The magnetic field variation can be measured by either simply placing a magnetometer on the chest of the subject using a belt [87] or placing a magnet and a magnetometer on the back and chest area of the subject, respectively [88]. Nevertheless, the use of a magnet enables lower power consumption. Magnetometers function best for quiet respiration, as the sensor data can be highly corrupted by motion artifacts.

As gyroscopes can only determine rotational movement of the thorax, any drift in their three-dimensional (3D) position can result in errors [85] in breath rate detection. Therefore, they are often used in conjunction with accelerometers to provide more accurate signals [86]. Furthermore, movements from breathing activities can be detected by measuring the magnetic field strength around the chest area using a magnetometer. The magnetic field variation can be measured by either simply placing a magnetometer on the chest of the subject using a belt [87] or placing a magnet and a magnetometer on the back and chest area of the subject, respectively [88]. Nevertheless, the use of a magnet enables lower power consumption. Magnetometers function best for quiet respiration, as the sensor data can be highly corrupted by motion artifacts. On the other hand, a sensor unit can be formed by incorporating a triaxial accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer to monitor the 3D movement of the thorax.

accelerometers [82], this type of system suﬀers from high measurement errors during exercise and
walking activities [83]. Furthermore, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope can be used
to estimate breath rate by measuring the angular velocity of the thorax during respiration. An insight
into the working principle of gyroscopes can be found in [84]. As gyroscopes can only determine
rotational movement of the thorax, any drift in their three-dimensional (3D) position can result in

this new sensor is proven to be less sensitive to motion artifacts [89] and, therefore, can provide better
respiration data. The standard setup of a 3D movement sensing-based respiratory rate monitoring
system can be seen in Figure 6b.

2.4.2. Blood Pressure Sensing

Heart rate can be monitored by sensing blood pressure. The rhythmic pulsation of the heart causes
pressure of blood on the walls of blood vessels. A sensor can be appropriately placed on the human body
(e.g., wrist, upper arm) to capture the instantaneous pressure of blood resulting from heartbeat [90].
The blood pressure measurement can be either non-invasive or invasive. The non-invasive methods of
measuring blood pressure include palpatory, auscultatory, ultrasonic, tonometry and oscillometric
sensing [91]. The palpatory and auscultatory methods are manually performed by the physician. In the
palpatory method, an inﬂatable cuﬀ is placed around the upper arm of the subject [92]. The health
specialist applies pressure on the cuﬀ until there is no blood ﬂow in the branchial artery. A manometer
connected to the inﬂatable cuﬀ is used to display the pressure applied. The systolic pressure of the
subject corresponds to that resulting from the pulse while the cuﬀ is under pressure. Even though the
palpatory sensing of blood pressure is less dependent on environmental factors, it can only measure
the systolic blood pressure of the patient [92]. Similarly, in the auscultatory method, the taping sounds
or Korotkoﬀ sounds are detected by a stethoscope which is connected to the cuﬀ. The physician slowly
applies pressure on the inﬂatable cuﬀ attached to the upper arm of the patient. The onset sound
detected by the stethoscope represents the systolic arterial pressure of the patient while the last sound
detected corresponds to his diastolic pressure. Despite its ability to measure both the systolic and
the diastolic blood pressures, this intermittent method is not suitable for continuous monitoring of
vital signs. The oscillometric technique on the other hand can be automated even if it is not used
for continuous measurements. In this technique, the cuﬀ is inﬂated to a preset value. While the
pressure is being released, oscillations appear and disappear at blood vessel. These oscillations are
recorded by the manometer. The maximum oscillation is equivalent to the mean arterial pressure.
Diﬀerent algorithms can be used by diﬀerent manufacturers in order to determine the systolic and
diastolic blood pressures [93]. However, in principle, the systolic blood pressure corresponds to the
increase in oscillation when blood ﬂows through the cuﬀ while the diastolic pressure corresponds
to the disappearance of the oscillations [93]. It is reported in [94] that the oscillometric method had
similar blood pressure measurement accuracy as the auscultatory method. Furthermore, ultrasonic
sensors or ﬂowmeters can be used to measure the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This type
of measurement is based on the Doppler eﬀect where the ultrasonic frequency shift due to blood
movement is proportional to the velocity of the blood ﬂow in the vessel. The sensor can, therefore,
capture the blood pressure in the form of an image. The ultrasonic measurement of blood pressure
usually involves a cuﬀ [95] and the sensor is often placed on the patient’s carotid artery [96–98].

Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

Furthermore, the arterial tonometry requires a manometer sensor placed on top of the radial artery
around the wrist. The force exerted by the sensor ﬂattens the artery and hence the intra-arterial blood
pressure is directly transmitted to the manometer through the skin [99]. The use of inﬂatable cuﬀ is not
necessary in the arterial tonometry blood pressure measurement. Despite its ability to continuously
measure the blood pressure in an automated manner, this method suﬀers from inaccuracies due to
misalignment, vertical and moderate pressurizations [100]. Figure 7 [101] depicts the general system
setup of a cuﬀ-based blood pressure measurement technique. Alternatively, blood pressure can be
continuously monitored using invasive methods. For instance, a needle attached to a tube called a
cannula can be inserted into the artery of the patient to measure blood pressure through a manometer.
This method gives the most accurate results of blood pressure and hence heart rate. However, it is
not practically desired for long durations monitoring due to its invasive nature. The aforementioned
methods are primarily used to measure blood pressure even though heart rate and heart rate variability
can be extracted as well. A method used to obtain solely heart signals is phonocardiography (PCG),
which will be discussed in the next section.

Figure 7. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) measurement using cuﬀ [101].

2.5. Phonocardiography (PCG)

During the opening and closing of the valves, the heart produces sounds that can be detected by a
microphone. The production of this acoustic eﬀect results from several actions including contraction
and relaxation of the heart muscle, rising and falling pressures of cardiac cavities, opening and closing
of the valves and blood circulating and stopping. The record of this cardiac acoustic phenomena may
help cardiac events to be visualized [102]. The system involving the detection of the heart rate based on
the cardiac sounds is called phonocardiography (PCG). The system setup of PCG is given in Figure 8a.
It is composed of a transducer element (i.e., a microphone), an analog interface containing an ampliﬁer
and a ﬁlter and a signal processing unit. The transducer can be attached to the patient’s body using a
belt or embedded into a cloth. Figure 8b represents a typical heart sound sketch in comparison with
the gold standard ECG signal. Due to the cardiac mechanical activities, two normal sounds denoted by
S1 and S2 can be recorded. In general, S1 has lower frequency compared to S2. The systole cycle is
indicated by the time taken by the heart to leave S1 and arrive at S2, while the diastole is the duration
between S2 and S1. There are two abnormal sounds (S3 and S4). The abnormal sounds are often
referred to as murmurs. Murmurs and other abnormal cardiac sounds can be indicators of disease [103].
The PCG curves demonstrate quasi-accurate beat-to-beat cardiac pattern and is comparable to the
ECG acquisition system. Despite its wide applications in the early twentieth century, PCG failed to
keep up with standardization due to the emergence of other auscultatory cardiac signal assessment
methods [104]. This is also due to the vulnerability of the system to surrounding acoustic eﬀects and
sounds from respiration that are much stronger than the cardiac sounds.

the table, the motion artifact appears to be one of the main challenges of contact-based BR and HR
measurement methods. As previously discussed, these techniques involve the use of contact electrodes.
Often, these probes need to be tightly attached to the body of the patient in order to obtain more
accurate results. Therefore, they may cause skin irritation and discomfort, making them impractical for
long-term or continuous monitoring. Therefore, many recent research activities were directed towards
the development of contactless cardio-respiratory monitoring systems using radar techniques. The
following section will be devoted to the application of diﬀerent types of radars in vital signs detection.

3. Contactless Vital Signs Detection Using Radar Techniques

Unlike the aforementioned contact-based vital signs monitoring systems, radars do not require
any contact probe to be attached to the body of the human being to acquire respiratory and cardiac
rates with high accuracy. Vital signs detection radars rely on the modulation eﬀect of a radio signal
sent by a transceiver towards the patient. This modulation is due to the chest-wall displacement
of the patient, which contains both the respiratory and heart signal along with environmental and
electronic noises. The noise is removed during signal processing to provide clean vital signs of the
subject. Note that the vital signs radars do not have severe power emission requirements for short
distances application (up to a couple of meters). Typically, the power transmitted by the radar does not
exceed 12 dBm for a two-meters distance application, which is less than the average power emitted by

a smartphone. Therefore, these radars are safe. Depending on the type of signal it transmits, the radar
can be of type continuous-wave (CW), pulsed, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) or
stepped-frequency continuous-wave (SFCW).

3.1. Continuous-Wave Radars

3.1.1. Operation Principle

The CW radars are the most common type due to their simplicity. A typical radar has a transceiver
unit connected to the transmitting and receiving antennas and a digital signal-processing unit, as seen
in Figure 9a. The transceiver sends a single-tone continuous-wave signal towards the moving chest of
the subject through the transmitter (Tx) antenna. The reﬂected wave is captured by the receiver (Rx)
antenna. The received signal is demodulated and processed by a computer to obtain the breath and
heart rates.

frequency (IF); (c) heterodyne.

The time-domain transmitted signal, denoted by T(t) and the received signal by R(t) are:

where At and Ar are the amplitudes of the transmitted and received signals, respectively; ω the angular
frequency of the transmitted signal; λ the carrier wavelength; c the speed of the light; d0 the constant
distance between the antennas and the subject; x(t) the instantaneous displacement of the chest, given
by (3):

x(t) = AbCos(ω

(3)

where Ab, Ah, ϕb and ϕh are the amplitudes and the phase shifts of the chest displacement due
to breathing and heartbeat, respectively. As seen from (1) and (2), the signal sent by the radar is
modulated in frequency and phase due to the displacement of the chest. This modulation is called the
Doppler eﬀect.

The transceiver can be of type heterodyne, where the intermediate frequency (IF) is non-zero or
type zero-IF (direct-conversion), where the IF is zero. As shown in Figure 9b, the zero-IF transceivers
are simpler and thus less power hungry than their heterodyne counterparts. However, they suﬀer
from large ﬂicker noise corruption and direct-current (DC) oﬀset [105]. On the other hand, the
heterodyne structure often requires both up-conversion and down-conversion of the signal and a local
oscillator (LO) (Figure 9c), increasing the power consumption and complexity of the system. Another
commonly used CW radar architecture is the low-IF CW radar, which is similar to the heterodyne
structure with IF values ranging from a couple of kilohertz to several megahertz [106,107]. This
type of CW radar allows not only the suppression of DC oﬀset through ﬁltering but also the use
of commercially available analog-to-digital-converters (ADCs) [106]. Moreover, the low-IF radar

The transceiver sends a single-tone continuous-wave signal towards the moving chest of the subject through the transmitter (Tx) antenna. The reflected wave is captured by the receiver (Rx) antenna. The received signal is demodulated and processed by a computer to obtain the breath and heart rates. The time-domain transmitted signal, denoted by T(t) and the received signal by R(t) are: T(t)=AtCos(ωt+φ(t)), (1) R(t)=ArCos[ωt−4πλ(d0+x(t))+φ(t−2d0c)], (2) where At and Ar are the amplitudes of the transmitted and received signals, respectively; ω the angular frequency of the transmitted signal; λ the carrier wavelength; c the speed of the light; d0 the constant distance between the antennas and the subject; x(t) the instantaneous displacement of the chest, given by (3): 𝑥(𝑡)=𝐴𝑏𝐶𝑜𝑠(𝜔𝑏𝑡+𝜑𝑏)+𝐴ℎ𝐶𝑜𝑠(𝜔ℎ𝑡+𝜑ℎ), (3) where Ab, Ah, φb and φh are the amplitudes and the phase shifts of the chest displacement due to breathing and heartbeat, respectively. As seen from (1) and (2), the signal sent by the radar is modulated in frequency and phase due to the displacement of the chest. This modulation is called the Doppler effect. The transceiver can be of type heterodyne, where the intermediate frequency (IF) is non-zero or type zero-IF (direct-conversion), where the IF is zero. As shown in Figure 9b, the zero-IF transceivers are simpler and thus less power hungry than their heterodyne counterparts. However, they suffer from large flicker noise corruption and direct-current (DC) offset [105]. On the other hand, the heterodyne structure often requires both up-conversion and down-conversion of the signal and a local oscillator (LO) (Figure 9c), increasing the power consumption and complexity of the system. Another commonly used CW radar architecture is the low-IF CW radar, which is similar to the heterodyne structure with IF values ranging from a couple of kilohertz to several megahertz [106,107]. This type of CW radar allows not only the suppression of DC offset through filtering but also the use of commercially available analog-to-digital-converters (ADCs) [106]. Moreover, the low-IF radar transmission can be either double sideband (DSB) where the upper and lower intermediate frequency components are transmitted and received, or single sideband (SSB), where only one intermediate frequency component is received [107]. In [107], it has been shown that the SSB transmission mode with quadrature demodulation avoids the null-point detection, which occurs when the received signal is in phase or 180° out-of-phase with respect to the local oscillator frequency [108]. Even though the low-IF transceiver architectures have better performance in terms of noise and DC offsets, the direct-conversion architectures are preferred for millimeter-wave applications due to their simplicity. However, it is difficult to design high performant I/Q mixers at these frequencies. To deal with the DC offset and the RF leakage to the baseband branch, a band pass filter can be placed after the quadrature mixer in Figure 9b.     Figure 9. (a) Block diagram of vital signs Doppler. Basic transceiver architectures: (b) zero intermediate frequency (IF); (c) heterodyne. Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

transmission can be either double sideband (DSB) where the upper and lower intermediate frequency
components are transmitted and received, or single sideband (SSB), where only one intermediate
frequency component is received [107]. In [107], it has been shown that the SSB transmission mode
with quadrature demodulation avoids the null-point detection, which occurs when the received signal

is in phase or 180

the low-IF transceiver architectures have better performance in terms of noise and DC oﬀsets, the
direct-conversion architectures are preferred for millimeter-wave applications due to their simplicity.
However, it is diﬃcult to design high performant I/Q mixers at these frequencies. To deal with the DC
oﬀset and the RF leakage to the baseband branch, a band pass ﬁlter can be placed after the quadrature
mixer in Figure 9b.

The baseband signals are obtained after demodulation by the quadrature mixer then subsequently
ﬁltered, further ampliﬁed by the variable-gain ampliﬁer (VGA) and digitized by the ADC before being
processed by a computer. For a zero-IF radar, the in-phase baseband signal BI (t) is obtained by mixing
a replica of the transmitted signal in (1) with the received signal in (2):

BI(t) = T(t) × R(t),

The above I and Q baseband signals are used in signal processing to determine the vital signs.

3.1.2. Algorithms and Signal Processing

Various analysis methods can be used with the data of CW in order to accurately extract the vital
signs. These methods can be classiﬁed as time-frequency analysis, numerical analysis, classiﬁcation
and training and algorithms based on mathematical and experimental modelling [108].

The time and frequency domain analysis have been extensively used in the literature to obtain
HR and BR from CW Doppler radars. Peak detection methods are mainly used as a time-domain
method to detect the peaks of respiration and heart signals. These include the autocorrelation output
with fast Fourier transform (FFT) [109] and methods based on statistics of the time domain data to
diﬀerentiate between the time-varying signals and the signal corresponding to stationary objects [110].
Furthermore, the frequency methods use Fourier transform techniques and the chirp Z-transforms
(CZT) to extract the vital signs. The FFT is the most popular Fourier transform method used in radar
signal processing. The two most common signal analyzing methods exploiting FFT for CW Doppler
radars are the arctangent demodulation (AD) and the complex signal demodulation (CSD). In AD,
the quadrature baseband signal is divided by the in-phase baseband signal, and the arctangent of the
resulting signal is obtained. Furthermore, the FFT is applied to extract the spectrum of the heartbeat
and the respiration signals (Figure 10a). A diﬀerentiator is often used to the signal before taking the
FFT in order to remove the DC oﬀset. The AD method is moderately insensitive to the phase noises
of the LO and the mixer, but limited by the DC oﬀset and phase imbalance of the I and Q baseband
signals [108]. On the other hand, the CSD consists of expressing the baseband I and Q signals into a
complex form using Bessel’s function and taking the complex Fourier transform of the result [111]
(Figure 10b). The CSD is more robust and tolerant to DC oﬀset, however, it suﬀers from the harmonics
and noise in the baseband signals. On the other hand, the CZT can also be used as an alternative to the
FFT [112] and provides good accuracy with a smaller number of samples [113].

demodulation (CSD) signal processing.

Moreover, diﬀerent numerical analysis approaches can be employed to analyze the CW radar
data [114]. These include the mean of signals (MEAN), the least squares (LS), The Hough transformation
(HOUGH) and the particle ﬁlter (PF). These methods are used to identify the oﬀset component of the
data. The MEAN is used to estimate the oﬀset of the signal by assuming the oﬀset remains stable
while the phase data changes between 0 and 2π. In the LS method, the data is ﬁt into a circle with
center corresponding to the oﬀset. In the HOUGH method, the data is divided into grid cells and
the Hough transform is used to deﬁne a circle from the grids. Alternatively, a Bayesian ﬁlter can be
used as PF to estimate the oﬀset of the data. Furthermore, a method called the direct phase estimation
based on vector diﬀerence can be used to determine the vital signs. Cardio-respiratory rates can also be
estimated using the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) [115] with fair results. The wavelet analysis is widely
used to determine human HR and BR due to its eﬀectiveness for low-frequency signals [116,117].

Furthermore, classiﬁcation methods can be used to process CW radar data and estimate the BR and
HR. In [118], an algorithm was developed for classifying diﬀerent sleep stages based on the respiration
and the body movements. The developed sensor exhibits good results in terms of sleep/wake pattern
monitoring. Moreover, a bio-sensor was developed in [119] using a linear discriminants classiﬁer for
determining sleep/wake pattern.

Finally, experimental and mathematical modelling can be used to estimate human vital signs.
In [120], the authors established a linear relation between lung volume and chest-wall displacement
using experimental data. The radar data can, therefore, be used to estimate the tidal volume based
on this relationship. Furthermore, the authors in [121] proposed a mathematical model relating
the intrapulmonary pressure and the chest-wall displacement. Then, the tidal volume is estimated
using the baseband signals of the Doppler radar. The results from these modelling methods show
good accuracy.

human subjects located at 30 cm to the device [122]. Since then, a lot of research activities have been
undertaken to improve the performance of this type of radar. In [109], a CW radar operating at 2.4
GHz was designed and tested with a human subject located at 1.5 cm from the radar. The respiratory
and cardiac rates obtained exhibited mean errors less than 0.5 beat/min and 1 beat/min, respectively.
A W-band millimeter-wave radar was successfully designed and tested on a human subject in [123].
In [124], a Doppler radar was designed at 60 GHz for short-range detection of human presence as
well as vital signs detection. The experimental results show promising performance for occupancy
applications. Multi-target vital signs detection were made possible with Doppler CW radar prototypes
using multiple beamforming in [125] and [126]. The aforementioned examples show the ability of CW
radar to detect the heart and respiration rates of human subjects under motionless testing conditions.
However, the real-world application of vital signs detection radars encounter several diﬃculties that
are discussed next.

3.1.4. Challenges

The CW radars face numerous challenges during the detection of heart and respiration rates
including null-point detection, signal corruption from the phase noises of the LO and the mixer, random
body movement (RBM) of the subject, separation of heartbeat signal from respiration signal, multiple
targets detection etc. The null-point detection and phase-noise issues can be adequately dealt with
by using a proper CW transceiver architecture (low-IF single SSB) and signal processing (CSD) [111].
However, issues like RBM, accurate heartbeat detection and multiple-subjects detection require more
sophisticated architectures and signal processing techniques, increasing the complexity and power
consumption of precise CW vital detection radars. These technical challenges are part of the reasons
why vital sign radars do not exist in the consumer market to this day [127].

During the acquisition of the vital signs, the subject may often move body parts like hands and
legs or his entire body. These unwanted body movements are called random body movements. The
signals reﬂected due to RBMs are stronger than the vital signals, therefore corrupting the latter. Hence,
it is necessary to incorporate an RBM cancellation mechanism in the radar. Several methods of RBM
mitigation were proposed in the literature. One method of cancelling the RBM is the use of two
identical CW transceivers and the CSD [122]. Another method used to cancel RBM eﬀect in vital
signs acquisition is the radar implementation with self-injection locking [128]. In [129], the empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) signal-processing technique was used to remove motion artifacts from
the antenna and the subject. Another signal-processing method was used in [130] to remove the RBM
eﬀect on human vital signs. Even though the forward and backward movements are easily cancelled
out in these papers, they usually require more complex and power-consuming systems. The above
RBM mitigation techniques are detailed in Section 3.5.

Furthermore, the ability of the radar to detect a precise and accurate heart signal is challenging.
The frequency of the human heartbeat (1–3 Hz) lies close to that of the respiration (0.1–0.9 Hz). Since
the heartbeat signal is much smaller in amplitude compared to the respiration signal, it can easily be
corrupted by the harmonics of the latter. Therefore, it is often required to take adequate measures
In [131], a signal-processing method called parameterized
for recovering the heartbeat signals.
demodulation is used to separate the heart signal from the respiration one. A simple direct-conversion
radar with very narrow beam dual helical antennas was designed in [132] for automotive application.
The time domain measurement results show the heartbeat signal of a human subject. Nevertheless,
the antennas are required to be very directional and the chest-wall displacement due to respiration is
assumed to be relatively constant. Another method of accurately detecting the small heartbeat signal in
the presence of stronger breathing signal is the use of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. Since
the phase shift due to the displacement of the target is inversely proportional to the carrier wavelength,
smaller movements of the chest-wall due to heartbeat may be detected with precision at higher radar
carrier frequencies. In [133] and [134], the authors implemented millimeter-wave radars that were able
to detect both BR and HR without using sophisticated signal-processing methods.

Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

Moreover, for applications such as surveillance and human presence detection, the Doppler radar
must be able to detect the vital signs of multiple human subjects at the same time. Simple CW radars
cannot fulﬁl this functionality since single tone CW signals cannot provide range information [135].
Therefore, the radar signal needs to be frequency-modulated in order to detect multiple subjects.
Examples of such radars include the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars and
stepped-frequency continuous-wave radars (SFCW), which will be discussed next.

3.2. Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) Radars

3.2.1. Operation Principle

In FMCW radar systems, the frequency of the output signal is varied linearly with respect to time.
Represented in Figure 11, this type of signal is composed of a unity signal called chirp generated at
every period T. The chirp can be generated by feeding a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a
linear control voltage. Alternatively, the chirp can be generated by using a phase-locked-loop (PLL)
with frequency synthesizers [136]. The transceiver architectures of FMCW radars are similar to that of
CW Doppler ones. Nevertheless, a direct-conversion system is often used in order to decrease the high
computational loads [137]. Directly converting the received signal with a replica of the transmitted one
is called de-chirping. The demodulated signal is often called the “beat signal”. It contains both the
range and micro-doppler information. The data obtained from the radar can be put in a matrix form
containing the slow-time and fast time data. The slow-time data is related to the number of transmitted
ramps and contains the range information. On the other hand, the fast-time time data indicates the
number of samples per ramp and contains the vital signs information.

(b) instantaneous chirp signals.

3.2.2. Algorithms and Signal Processing

The FMCW radars are capable of providing both the range and Doppler information. Therefore,
the vital signs of multiple subjects located in the line-of-sight of the antennas can be detected. The
basic algorithm of used in FMCW radar data analysis involve localization of the subject and detection
of HR and BR associated with each range as seen in Figure 12. Diﬀerent signal-processing methods
can be employed for removing noises, DC oﬀsets or MA eﬀects. However, the most popular signal
processing is the time-frequency method employing the FFT to extract the vital signs and the range
information. In [138], the authors used an auto-regression algorithm to extract the cardio-respiratory
rates of the subjects. In the AR analysis, the regular frequencies are sought among a constant signal,
allowing the extraction of HR and BR [139]. The range and the phase information were obtained by

the parametric data estimation and the FFT, respectively. Figure 13a shows the summarized algorithm
used to detect the vital signs of the subject-under-test (SUT). Furthermore, A series of FFT and DC
compensations were used in [140] for determining the vital signs of a patient lying on a bed. The vital
signs’ extraction algorithm is given in Figure 13b. In this analysis, the DC compensation is crucial for
the phase unwrapping processing, which precedes the retrieval of the vital signs. The results from
the experiments show accuracies of 80% and 94% for HR and BR, respectively. Lastly, the authors
in [141], uses multiple antennas to detect and locate the vital signs of two SUTs. The block diagram of
the signal-processing employed in that work is given in Figure 13c. The frequency domain processing
is used to eﬀectively extract both BR and HR. To remove the user-induced motion artifact, a certain
signal energy threshold value where any time window signal energy exceeding that value is omitted
from the data.

3.2.3. Biomedical Practice

Many recent research on non-contact vital signs sensing are based on FMCW radar techniques
as they overcome the shortcoming of the diﬃculty or inability in CW radars to provide the range
information. A portable short-range FMCW radar was developed in [142] for localization and tiny vital

signs detection of human subjects. The designed hybrid system was able to diﬀerentiate human subjects
from other surrounding objects. Furthermore, a millimeter-wave FMCW radar was implemented
in [140] for vital signs monitoring of a patient located at around 1.7 m from the radar. Showing
relatively low power consumption, this system may be used for long-term monitoring of patients.
In [141], An FMCW radar was able to detect a vibrating reﬂector and a human subject located at the
same range bin, with the help of beamforming.

3.2.4. Challenges

The use of FMCW radars for vital signs detection does not eliminate issues such as RBM eﬀect
and separation of the respiratory signal from the cardiac signal as previously discussed. Another
important issue arising in the operation of FMCW radars is the incoherence of the radar. Incoherence
occurs when the radar is unable to detect the micro-doppler signature which is contained in the phase
data [137]. Therefore, it is necessary to control the phase of the radar waveform. In addition, the
range resolution of FMCW radars is limited by the bandwidth [143]. Higher resolution implies higher
bandwidth. For instance, the range resolution of a 10 GHz FMCW radar is around 1.5 cm. However
designs of modules such as VCO is challenging due to higher-phase noise level. Furthermore, the VCO
may not exhibit a linear frequency sweeping. Hence, calibration is often required in the operation of
high-bandwidth FMCW radars [143,144] in order to maintain linearity. FMCW radars provide ﬁne
range and Doppler information. However, the power consumption in these radars is relatively higher
compared to the CW radars. One type of radar capable of providing both the range and micro-doppler
information with relatively lower power consumption is the SFCW radar, which will be discussed in
the following section.

3.3. Stepped-Frequency Continuous-Wave (SFCW) Radars

3.3.1. Operation Principle

The operation of SFCW radars is similar to that of FMCW ones. In this case, a series of N frames
are linearly transmitted towards the target with a time interval of ∆f between each frame, as seen in
Figure 14. The reﬂected signal is down-converted with a replica of the transmitted one to obtain the
beat intermediate frequency.

CW and FMCW radars. Nevertheless, they detain similar algorithms and signal processing techniques
to their FMCW counterparts as they allow localization and multi-subjects detection. Meanwhile, most

the radar is put into a time-frequency matrix of J × N size, where J and N indicate the total number of
frequency sweeps and the number of radio frequency (RF) steps, respectively [145]. Next a consecutive
FFT is applied to the matrix to obtain a range Doppler proﬁle seen in Figure 15c. An example of raw
data obtained after the inverse FFT (IFFT) is applied to the frequency domain signal of an SFCW radar
is presented in Figure 15a,b [146]. The radar implemented was used to detect the presence of a human
subject under brick layers.

3.3.3. Biomedical Practice

SFCW radars have been actively investigated for biomedical applications. Due to their simplicity
compared to the FMCW radar, this type of radar is becoming quite attractive for contactless
cardio-respiratory signal detection and monitoring in recent years.
In [147], experiments using
a SFCW radar was performed to successfully obtain the cardio-respiratory rate and the respective
locations of three individuals at the same time. Furthermore, the performance of the radar was
evaluated for diﬀerent parameters including the center frequency of the radar, the bandwidth, the
frequency step and the properties of the antenna. An SFCW radar centered at 3 GHz with 2 GHz
bandwidth was implemented and tested with a human subject located at diﬀerent distances from 1
m to 2 m in [148]. The results of the cardiac and respiratory rates showed an error of less than 2%.
An experiment was performed to evaluate the performance of an SFCW radar for measuring the vital
signs of an individual at diﬀerent body orientations in [149]. Despite having better performances at the
front and back positions, the radar exhibits errors of no more than 2% for all the four positions. In [146],
an SFCW radar was setup using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and two antennas to evaluate its
detection accuracy of the vital signs of a human under concrete in laboratory conditions. The radar
showed capability of non-line of sight detection of human respiratory signals at a distance of 1 m or
higher with high speed and regardless of the posture of the subject. This shows a great potential of
SFCW radars in the application of search and rescue during natural disasters like earthquakes.

Similar to the CW and FMCW radars, the SFCW radars suﬀer from the motion artifact of the
subject as the major bottleneck. Additionally, the presence of respiratory harmonics on the vital signs
undermine the accuracy of the heart rate.

Even though the radars discussed in the previous sections have high sensitivity, they suﬀer from
low power eﬃciency and are not preferred for the detection of humans behind concretes. On the other
hand, pulsed radars have the advantage of higher power eﬃciency and can be used to detect the vital
signs of humans located behind non-conductive materials such as concrete walls and tables. This type
of radar will be discussed in the following section.

3.4. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Pulse-Based Radars

3.4.1. Operation Principle

In pulse-based sensing radars, a short time (e.g., sub-nanosecond) domain modulated or
un-modulated pulse is sent by the radar’s transmitter towards the patient. The reﬂected echo
is captured by the receiver and processed in time domain to obtain the cardio-respiratory signals
of the subject. The most common pulse-based radar for vital signs sensing is the impulse radio
ultra-wideband radar (IR-UWB). The typical architecture of IR-UWB radars is depicted in Figure 16c.
The echoes of the transmitted pulses are received by an analog receiver and sampled using a delayed
replica of the transmitted one [150]. The oﬀset block represents a delay equivalent to the time-of-ﬂight
of the pulse. The time-of-ﬂight corresponds to the total time it takes the pulse to travel from the
transmitter antenna and return back to the receiver antenna. The typical pulse generated by IR-UWB
radars is represented in Figure 16a,b.

radars depending on the speciﬁc applications. A simple UWB employing body movement cancellation
was designed in [151]. It uses the CZT method and motion ﬁlter in order to retrieve the respiration and
eliminate the MA eﬀect. Even though the results appear to be good for detecting the respiration rate,

into higher SNR and allows the reduction of high harmonics. Figure 17a presents the ﬂow chart of the
new algorithm along with a reference FFT-based algorithm. Moreover, a signal-processing method
based on time and pulse-doppler domains were applied in [150] to obtain the cardio-respiratory rates
of sleeping individuals with very high accuracy. Figure 17b displays the ﬂow chart of the signal
processing. Many other signal-processing methods are used in UWB radars to obtain human vital
signs with good accuaracy. Hilbert Huang transform [HHT] and FFT in the time-frequency domain are
used to process the received signal in [153]. Classical arctangent demodulation (AD) [154–157], and
complex signal demodulation (CSD) [154,155] are also employed for extraction of vital signs in UWB
radars. Clutter eﬀect can be removed by using the singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) [158].
In [159], the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
were used in a UWB radar to improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and separate the respiration
and heartbeat signals. A low complexity approximation employing the maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation of the period of the signal mixed with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) was proposed
and tested in [160].

3.4.3. Biomedical Practice

The UWB radars are extensively used in many biomedical applications. Due to the ability of the
UWB pulse to penetrate concrete, a plethora of research has been conducted into detection of humans
behind walls and other concrete objects. This feature gives the advantage of UWB radar for applications
such as search and rescue surveillance and security. In [161], a UWB radar and signal processing
were developed to detect the human presence behind walls and concrete doors. The results show the
capability of the radar to sense humans behind walls and wooden doors. In [162], a ground-penetrating
radar based on UWB architecture was implemented and successfully experimented on a human subject
under a 3 cm thick table. In [158], a new signal-processing algorithm was developed to remove the
clutter noise of stationary and non-stationary object for the detection of human located under a pile of
concrete bricks. A monitoring radar was designed and implemented in [163] for indoor localization
and fall detection of human subjects. A multiple-antenna radar was designed and tested using diﬀerent
signal-processing methods for real-time localization and tracking of human subjects in an indoor setup
in [164]. The radar and signal processing algorithm proposed in [165] was able to successfully detect
the vital signs of two stationary persons and a moving person. In [136], a study has been conducted to
determine the heart rate variability of human subjects and extrapolate this data to predict the mental
state of the subject. The results show an accuracy of 82% for the classiﬁcation of the mental state.

Random Body Movement (RBM) Cancellation Techniques in Doppler Radars As stated in the previous sections, RBM remains the main challenge in human vital signs detection using radar techniques. Several RBM mitigation techniques are studied in the literature. One method of cancelling the RBM is the use of two identical CW transceivers and the CSD [111]. The two transceivers, one placed in front of the subject and the other at the back, simultaneously send a CW signal to the subject (Figure 19a). The respiration and heartbeat of the subject are in-phase for the two transceivers while the velocity of the body movement are opposite. Taking the scalar product of the signals received by the two transceivers, the RBM effect is removed. This technique is able to recover the vital signs of a human subject in the presence of large-scale forward and backward body movements. However, it requires the use of two transceivers that need to be identical and able to send the same types of signals at the same time. Another method used to cancel the RBM effect in vital signs acquisition is the radar implementation with self-injection locking [128]. As shown in Figure 19b, the radar has two antennas, one located at the front and the other located at the back of the individual. A CW signal is sent from the front antenna towards the chest of the subject. The same antenna collects the received signal and Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

The IR-UWB radars have been proven to have great feasibility in search and rescue and security
applications due to their low power consumption and excellent ability to penetrate non-conductive
material. However, a number of limitations impede their popularity over the Doppler radars. One
of the fundamental issues with the IR-UWB radars is their power density limitation. For safety and
interference with other devices purposes, power density masks are provided by telecommunication
regulators such as the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and the European Electronic
Communication Commission (ECC) (Figure 18). These masks provide the maximum power density
that a UWB device can have. For instance, the power emission in UWB radars is limited to −41.3
dBm/Hz for indoor applications in the United States. As a result, the UWB vital signs radars are limited
to short distance applications only. Furthermore, the SNR is high as emitted signal power is low.

Commission (ECC) masks for UWB application [166].

Table 2 gives a summary of performance factors of diﬀerent radar types used for vital signs

which will be discussed next.

3.5. Random Body Movement (RBM) Cancellation Techniques in Doppler Radars

As stated in the previous sections, RBM remains the main challenge in human vital signs detection

using radar techniques. Several RBM mitigation techniques are studied in the literature.

One method of cancelling the RBM is the use of two identical CW transceivers and the CSD [111].
The two transceivers, one placed in front of the subject and the other at the back, simultaneously send
a CW signal to the subject (Figure 19a). The respiration and heartbeat of the subject are in-phase for
the two transceivers while the velocity of the body movement are opposite. Taking the scalar product
of the signals received by the two transceivers, the RBM eﬀect is removed. This technique is able to
recover the vital signs of a human subject in the presence of large-scale forward and backward body
movements. However, it requires the use of two transceivers that need to be identical and able to send
the same types of signals at the same time.

Another method used to cancel the RBM eﬀect in vital signs acquisition is the radar implementation
with self-injection locking [128]. As shown in Figure 19b, the radar has two antennas, one located at
the front and the other located at the back of the individual. A CW signal is sent from the front antenna
towards the chest of the subject. The same antenna collects the received signal and resends it through
the circulators and the back antenna towards the back of the subject. The reﬂected signal from the back
of the subject is collected by the back antenna and injected to a self-injection locked oscillator (SILO). As
the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the RBM seen from the front of the subject is opposite to that seen from the
back, the signal received by the back antenna will not feature the RBM eﬀect. Even though large-scale
body movements are cancelled, the radar requires extra couplers, phase shifters and calibration to
remove the reﬂections from the surrounding environment, rendering the system more complex.

Furthermore, signal processing techniques can be used to remove unwanted body movement in
Doppler radars for vital signs detection. In [129], the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique
was used to remove motion artifacts from the antenna and the subject. In [130] the authors demonstrated
the possibility of measuring vital signs of humans by apply the cyclostatic transformation to Doppler
radars in presence of RBM. However, the SNR of the received signal must be high enough so the vital
signals would not fade during the non-linear transformation.

3.6. Heart Rate Variability Assessment Using Vital Signs Radar

The study on vital radars in this paper was mainly focused on the detection of HR and BR
and, therefore, does not address the beat-to-beat cardiac activities in details. Heart rate variability
(HRV) provides the time variation in beat-to-beat interval and is particularly important for correlating
the cardiovascular regulatory system response to stress, illness and demands [167]. In addition to
stress and emotion recognition, HRV assessment can be important for anxiety treatment and vigilance
monitoring [168]. Doppler radars have the capability of detecting beat-to-beat signal of human cardiac
activities with acceptable accuracy. In fact, many recent vitals radars articles were directed to the
evaluation of the radar in HRV assessment.

In [169], the authors conducted an experimental study of a 2.4 GHz CW radar in measuring the
HRV of three diﬀerent subjects. The linear demodulation method was used for signal processing of
the quadrature data obtained from the radar. The data from a ﬁnger pulse reference was also used in
comparison with the obtained results. The results obtained from the radar showed high accuracy in
detecting beat-to-beat interval as small as 1 ms. Furthermore, the authors in [168] performed the HRV
measurement experiment on 10 healthy subjects using a 24 GHz Doppler radar and novel algorithm.
The measurement results show a maximum mean relative error of 2.03% for the beat-to-beat interval
(BBI) acquisition. Figure 20 displays the BBI measurement obtained from the CW radar in comparison
with the measurement results from a reference ECG. Moreover, a millimeter-wave FMCW radar was

The reflected signal from the back of the subject is collected by the back antenna and injected to a self-injection locked oscillator (SILO). As the reflection coefficient of the RBM seen from the front of the subject is opposite to that seen from the back, the signal received by the back antenna will not feature the RBM effect. Even though large-scale body movements are cancelled, the radar requires extra couplers, phase shifters and calibration to remove the reflections from the surrounding environment, rendering the system more complex.

In fact, many recent vitals radars articles were directed to the evaluation of the radar in HRV assessment. In [169], the authors conducted an experimental study of a 2.4 GHz CW radar in measuring the HRV of three different subjects. The linear demodulation method was used for signal processing of the quadrature data obtained from the radar. The data from a finger pulse reference was also used in comparison with the obtained results. The results obtained from the radar showed high accuracy in detecting beat-to-beat interval as small as 1 ms. Furthermore, the authors in [168] performed the HRV measurement experiment on 10 healthy subjects using a 24 GHz Doppler radar and novel algorithm.

Figure 20 displays the BBI measurement obtained from the CW radar in comparison with the measurement results from a reference ECG. Moreover, a millimeter-wave FMCW radar was used in [170] to assess the HR variation of 3 different individuals sitting at distances between 0.6 m and 1 m. A reference measurement reading from Apple Watch show a high degree of agreement with the results obtained. Lastly, a UWB radar was used in [171] for classifying the mental states of different individuals into 4 categories, namely, the normal state, the fatigue state, the stress state and the sleep state using their HRV data. The radar operates at a center frequency of 7.29 GHz. A classification accuracy as high as 82% was obtained, which is sufficient for mental state classification. Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

3.7. Eﬀect of Frequency on the Detection Accuracy of Vital Signs Radars

The eﬀect of frequency on detection accuracy of human vital signs using Doppler radar has
not been intensively studied in the literature. However, several factors will need to be taken into
account to fully understand how the operating frequency of the radar impact vital signs acquisition.
First, the dielectric properties of the human body tissue must be studied. The complex dielectric
properties of human tissue was modelled by Gabriel et al. in [172] using the dispersed Cole–Cole
equation. It appears that the permittivity of human body tissue is related to the frequency and the
conductivity of the tissue. The attenuation coeﬃcient and the complex permittivity of human tissue
were estimated for the frequency range 8–18 GHz in [173] and for the range 10–60 GHz in [174]. The
real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant decrease at increasing frequencies within
the millimeter-wave band. However, the attenuation constant increases and hence, the skin depth
decreases. For instance, the skin depth of human skin at 10 GHz is just 2.7 mm [175]. Therefore,
the millimeter-wave signal is almost partially reﬂected and partially absorbed by the human skin,
which is the ﬁrst element to be in contact with the transmitted signal from the radar. Hence, the wave
reﬂection from body tissue at higher frequency is stronger than that at lower frequencies, which is an
advantage of using the millimeter-wave frequencies for vital signs detection. Nevertheless, the power
level needs to be low enough to avoid strong radiation against human body. Vital signs radar are
meant to operate for short range applications (from 0.5 m to 2 m in general), eliminating strict radiated
power requirements. Next, the path loss is another eﬀect that plays in the strength of the received
radar signal. The path loss is deﬁned as the attenuation of the electromagnetic wave as it propagates
through space. Since the spatial attenuation is proportional to the frequency, higher frequencies
experience more loss than lower frequencies. However, due the short-distance application and higher
sensitivities of Doppler radars, the path loss eﬀect does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the accuracy of the radar.
Lastly, as mentioned in Section 3.1.3, the phase shift due to chest displacement is proportional to the
carrier frequency. Therefore, smaller displacements can be detected when the radar is operating at
higher frequencies, which is useful for the detection of heartbeat. However, the detection accuracy
of the respiration becomes poor when the frequency is too high [133] because of the introduction of
phase ambiguity at target displacement larger than half of the wavelength of the operating frequency
(λ/2). Therefore there exists an optimal frequency of operation for the radar. In [176], the authors
demonstrated through simulation that the optimal carrier frequency of vital signs Doppler radars

Therefore there exists an optimal frequency of operation for the radar. In [176], the authors demonstrated through simulation that the optimal carrier frequency of vital signs Doppler radars for typical chest displacement corresponds to the lower Ka band (e.g., 27 GHz). Furthermore, the harmonics of the respiration become stronger at higher frequencies [177]. Hence, a proper harmonic cancellation mechanism must be employed during the signal processing especially when the CSD is used. Next, the results from an experiment setup using a CW radar and two human subjects will be presented and discussed. Future works needed for the application of vital signs radars in the consumer market will be emphasized. Next, we will evaluate the performance of a CW radar in respiration and heart rates acquisition using two human volunteers. Sensors 2020, 20, 1454

4. Experiment for Measuring Human Cardio-Respiratory Rates Using a Continuous-Wave (CW)
Doppler Radar

4.1. Experiment Setup

A proof-of-concept experimental setup has been constructed using a vector network analyzer
(VNA) and two horn antennas operating from 8 GHz to 15 GHz. As seen in Figure 21a, the SUT sits
at a distance of 1 m away from transmitting and receiving antennas, which are directly connected
to the VNA. Tripods are used to adjust the elevation of the antennas to the chest of the subject.
Single-tone CW at 10 GHz is transmitted and received as carrier. Three diﬀerent types of experiment
were performed with each SUT: the empty measurement, normal breathing, and holding breath. First,
empty measurement was conducted when no SUT or moving element is present in the antennas’ line of
sight. This type of measurement was performed once. It is used as a reference measurement to perform
background subtraction in order to eliminate the clutter eﬀect. In the second type of experiment, the
subject breathes normally and quietly with no other body movement. This type was performed at least
twice to ensure the agreement of the results. Finally, the subjects hold their breaths while sitting quietly
on the chair. This data provides only the heart rate which is compared to the rate obtained when the
SUT breathes normally. This type of measurement was performed a couple of times as well. Each
experiment session was performed for a duration of 30 s, which is enough to detect the respiration and
heart rates. To verify the feasibility of the system, male and a female volunteers participate in this
experiment. The signal processing was performed with a laptop using MATLAB software. De-noising,
ﬁltering and CSD algorithms were used to obtain the vital signs.

4.2. Data Processing

The aim of the signal processing is to obtain the BR and HR of the subject without employing
much complex algorithms. The summary of the signal analysis algorithm employed in this experiment
is depicted in Figure 22 The ﬁrst step was to subtract the clutter noise using the S21 of the normal
breathing and the empty measurement data from the VNA. Next, a band pass ﬁlter with bandwidth
between 0.1 Hz and 3.3 Hz was applied to preserve the vital signs content. Next, the resulting matrix
was expressed into a complex form necessary for the CSD method. Further, the FFT was employed to
obtain the ﬁrst and highest peak corresponding to the respiration rate, which occurred at a frequency
of 0.3 Hz. The respiration rate is associated with ﬁrst, second and third harmonics which are usually
stronger than the HR. The harmonics were cancelled using a notch adaptive ﬁlter with multiple center
frequencies at 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.8 Hz. Lastly, the pulse rate was extracted by searching for the highest
peak in the frequency range between 0.7 Hz and 3.3 Hz which includes the human heart rate under
resting conditions. In this experiment, the subject were at rest with no external body movement for
simplicity purposes.

4.3. Results and Discussion

The experimental results are given in Figure 21b,c, for the male and female subjects, respectively.
Filtering and background subtraction were used to remove the noise and harmonics of the respiratory
signal. A breath rate of 18 breaths per minute and a heart rate of 58 beats per minute were obtained
for the male subject. Moreover, these results were 20 breaths per minute and 78 beats per minute,
respectively for the female subject.

As seen from the above experiment, CW radars can be used to detect human BR and HR without

employing complex signal processing.

market. These include more accurate mechanisms for mitigating the 3D motion artifacts of the SUT
and less computational loads for vital signs acquisition while keeping the power consumption low.

Abstract: Respiratory rate is a fundamental vital sign that is sensitive to diﬀerent pathological
conditions (e.g., adverse cardiac events, pneumonia, and clinical deterioration) and stressors,
including emotional stress, cognitive load, heat, cold, physical eﬀort, and exercise-induced fatigue.
The sensitivity of respiratory rate to these conditions is superior compared to that of most of the other
vital signs, and the abundance of suitable technological solutions measuring respiratory rate has
important implications for healthcare, occupational settings, and sport. However, respiratory rate is
still too often not routinely monitored in these ﬁelds of use. This review presents a multidisciplinary
approach to respiratory monitoring, with the aim to improve the development and eﬃcacy of
respiratory monitoring services. We have identiﬁed thirteen monitoring goals where the use of
the respiratory rate is invaluable, and for each of them we have described suitable sensors and
techniques to monitor respiratory rate in speciﬁc measurement scenarios. We have also provided a
physiological rationale corroborating the importance of respiratory rate monitoring and an original
multidisciplinary framework for the development of respiratory monitoring services. This review
is expected to advance the ﬁeld of respiratory monitoring and favor synergies between diﬀerent
disciplines to accomplish this goal.

1. Introduction

A growing body of evidence suggests that respiratory rate, also known as respiratory frequency
(f R), is a fundamental variable to be monitored in diﬀerent ﬁelds. In healthcare, f R is a vital sign which
provides information on clinical deterioration, predicts cardiac arrest, and supports the diagnosis
of severe pneumonia [1–5]. Furthermore, f R responds to a variety of stressors, including emotional
stress, cognitive load, cold, and hyperthermia [6–9]. During exercise, f R is a good marker of physical
eﬀort and fatigue [10–17] and is associated with exercise tolerance in diﬀerent populations [14,18].
Recent advances in the understanding of the control of ventilation corroborate the importance
of monitoring f R and explain why f R but not tidal volume (VT) (the other component of minute
ventilation) responds to a variety of non-metabolic stressors [7,11,12,17,19–22]. Likewise, technological
development in the ﬁeld of sensors and techniques for measuring f R is growing exponentially, and a
series of measurement solutions are currently available [23–26]. The ever-increasing interest in
technological solutions for respiratory monitoring is manifested by the number of recent reviews
published on this topic [23–28]. These reviews describe the advanced state of the art of the development

of measurement systems for monitoring f R and other ventilatory variables [23–28]. Nevertheless, one of
the main challenges commonly highlighted is the limited use of respiratory systems in everyday-life
monitoring. This issue is especially evident from the ﬁndings of a recent systematic review by Vanegas
et al. [26]. Indeed, advances in respiratory physiology, applied sciences, and technology are not
yet accompanied by a large diﬀusion of eﬀective respiratory monitoring services in diﬀerent ﬁelds.
For instance, f R monitoring is not performed routinely in healthcare or in the ﬁeld of sport and
exercise [14,24,26]. A major factor determining this limitation is the inadequate establishment of
synergies between the diﬀerent disciplines related to respiratory monitoring.

This review proposes the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach to respiratory monitoring
as a solution to improve the development and eﬃcacy of f R monitoring services. We present a solid
physiological rationale explaining why f R is particularly sensitive to diﬀerent non-metabolic stressors,
thus corroborating the importance of f R monitoring for diﬀerent applications. Furthermore, we show
how the understanding of the f R response to diﬀerent stressors facilitates the identiﬁcation of suitable
sensors and techniques for f R monitoring in diﬀerent measurement scenarios. Related implications
for the development of measurement systems, algorithms, validation procedures, and respiratory
monitoring services are discussed in this review. Brieﬂy, Section 2 describes this approach in detail
for diﬀerent ﬁelds of use and applications, while Section 3 builds on such a multidisciplinary
approach to propose an original framework for the development of respiratory monitoring services.
Current challenges and directions for future research in the ﬁeld of f R monitoring are discussed
in Sections 4 and 5.

2. Goals and Measurement Scenarios Requiring Respiratory Rate Monitoring

This section presents a series of monitoring goals where the measurement of f R is invaluable,
but with no attempt to cover all the potentially relevant applications. These goals are organized
in diﬀerent subsections, each of which is composed of two parts: (1) Current evidence; and (2)
Measurement and Computing. The “Current evidence” sections present the importance of f R
monitoring for the speciﬁc goal identiﬁed, while the “Measurement and computing” sections describe
suitable sensors and techniques to monitor f R in speciﬁc measurement scenarios, which are taken as
examples (see Figure 1 for a schematic representation). With this structure, we show how the choice of
the f R measurement technique depends on speciﬁc monitoring goals and measurement scenarios and is
facilitated by the understanding of how f R responds to diﬀerent stressors. Accordingly, we provide the
reader with speciﬁc examples on how to use available technologies for diﬀerent applications and ﬁelds
of use. When relevant, we also comment on the need to complement f R monitoring with the measure
of other ventilatory variables (e.g., VT), and on the physiological rationale underlying this need.

2.1. Presence of Breathing

2.1.1. Current Evidence

Breathing is a vital physiological function of the human body. It guarantees gas exchange, acid–base
balance regulation, and other homeostatic functions even under stressful conditions. As such, f R is one
of the most fundamental vital signs [1,29]. Normal f R values (eupnea) range from 12 breaths/min to
20 breaths/min in adults [30], while the normal values for children vary according to age [31]. Diﬀerent
stressors acting on the human body determine variations in f R outside the eupnea range, and this topic
is covered in detail in the following subsections of Section 2. Diﬀerently, here we discuss the importance
of detecting the presence of breathing per se, which has relevant implications for diﬀerent ﬁelds of use.
For instance, it is valuable for survivor identiﬁcation in civil and military rescue scenarios [32] and for
children below one year of age that are at risk of sudden infant death syndrome [33,34]. Furthermore,
the assessment of breathing is fundamental in cardiorespiratory resuscitation. This evaluation is usually
performed by manual counting, although even trained medical students and healthcare professionals
may ﬁnd this task challenging [35,36]. Hence, the objective measurement of f R in cardiopulmonary

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

resuscitation procedures might help in emergency management. While the accurate and objective
monitoring of f R would also prove of great value for a variety of other applications, f R is often the least
recorded vital sign [14,29,37,38].

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the monitoring goals described in this review and related
examples of speciﬁc measurement scenarios.

2.1.2. Measurement and Computing

The ﬁrst requirement for any eﬀective respiratory monitoring service is the need to obtain a
good respiratory signal (respiratory waveform). This is particularly relevant when the aim is to
detect the presence of breathing per se, as portions of low-quality signal may impair the possibility to
unambiguously distinguish whether the user is breathing or not. However, this goal is complicated by
the fact that the quality of the respiratory signal is inﬂuenced by numerous factors, including the type
of sensors, the front-end/back-end electronics, the sensor(s) placement, undesired human movements,
and environmental factors. A possible solution to address this issue is the assessment of the quality
of the respiratory waveform before f R values are obtained, as even a suitable and validated sensor
may provide a low-quality signal under speciﬁc circumstances (e.g., misplacement of the sensors).
While this approach is not yet common in respiratory monitoring, a quantitative assessment of the
signal-to-noise ratio has been proposed by some researchers, with promising results. Given the indirect
nature of f R measurement from the electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG)
signals, it is not surprising that such an approach of respiratory signal quality assessment has been
used to a great extent when f R is extracted from these signals. For instance, signal quality indices
(SQI) are well-established indicators used to identify the presence of artifacts in the ECG and PPG
signals and to improve the robustness of f R estimation algorithms [39]. It has further been suggested
that ad-hoc respiratory quality index algorithms based on Fast-Fourier Transform, Autoregression,
Autocorrelation, and the Hjorth Parameter Complexity perform better than classical SQI in identifying

Presence of Breathing 2.1.1. Current Evidence Breathing is a vital physiological function of the human body. It guarantees gas exchange, acid–base balance regulation, and other homeostatic functions even under stressful conditions. As such, fR is one of the most fundamental vital signs [1,29]. Normal fR values (eupnea) range from 12 breaths/min to 20 breaths/min in adults [30], while the normal values for children vary according to age [31]. Different stressors acting on the human body determine variations in fR outside the eupnea range, and this topic is covered in detail in the following subsections of Section 2. Differently, here we discuss the importance of detecting the presence of breathing per se, which has relevant implications for different fields of use. For instance, it is valuable for survivor identification in civil and military rescue scenarios [32] and for children below one year of age that are at risk of sudden infant death syndrome [33,34]. Furthermore, the assessment of breathing is fundamental in cardiorespiratory resuscitation. This evaluation is usually performed by manual counting, although even trained medical students and healthcare professionals may find this task challenging [35,36]. Hence, the objective measurement of fR in cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures might help in emergency management. While the accurate and objective monitoring of fR would also prove of great value for a variety of other applications, fR is often the least recorded vital sign [14,29,37,38]. 2.1.2. Measurement and Computing The first requirement for any effective respiratory monitoring service is the need to obtain a good respiratory signal (respiratory waveform). This is particularly relevant when the aim is to detect the presence of breathing per se, as portions of low-quality signal may impair the possibility to unambiguously distinguish whether the user is breathing or not. However, this goal is complicated by the fact that the quality of the respiratory signal is influenced by numerous factors, Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

poor-quality respiratory waveforms extracted from raw PPG and ECG signals and in estimating f R [40].
In fact, the assessment of respiratory waveform signal quality can be applied to signals collected
with a variety of respiratory sensors and is particularly useful for signal selection when diﬀerent
sensors are used simultaneously. An example is the evaluation of the quality of signals collected with
diﬀerent strain sensors attached to the chest and abdomen, which is particularly relevant when the
respiratory signal is aﬀected by motion artifacts during physical activity [41,42]. A similar approach
was used by Siqueira et al. [43], who simultaneously recorded the respiratory waveform with multiple
tri-axial accelerometers positioned on the chest and the abdomen. They found that a method based on
independent component analysis was suitable to extract the respiratory waveform blindly, and that
the quality of the respiratory signal was inﬂuenced by the sensor location [43]. The use of a SQI was
also proposed for the quantiﬁcation of the signal-to-noise ratio of respiratory signals recorded with a
thermal camera [44]. The authors developed a SQI ranging from 0 to 1, which is based on four features
that take both high-frequency and low-frequency noise into account [44].

The rescue of trapped victims is a typical example of a measurement scenario where the
detection of the presence of breathing is of great value [32]. Contactless techniques can be used for
victim identiﬁcation, as the ultra-wideband (UWB) through-wall radar provides an estimation of
f R, while calculating at the same time the distance between the radar and the human subject [45].
This feature of UWB radars is essential for survivor identiﬁcation and location. However, a low
signal-to-noise ratio can be found in complex environments and may result in signiﬁcant errors in
the estimation of f R and distance. This problem can be counteracted with the development of robust
algorithms as proposed by Shikhsarmast et al. [45], who implemented a random-noise denoising and
clutter elimination algorithm using wavelet transform. Other approaches are based on complex signal
demodulation techniques and frequency accumulation methods to suppress mixed products of the
heartbeat and respiration signals and spurious respiration signal harmonics [46,47]. When the presence
of breathing needs to be assessed, it is preferable to measure f R on a breath-by-breath basis (see Table 1
for a summary).

2.2. Adverse Cardiac Events

2.2.1. Current Evidence

Substantial evidence suggests that an elevated resting f R is associated with cardiac arrest [1,2,48–51].
Indeed, f R was found to be the most accurate vital sign to predict this adverse cardiac event [2,48,50,51],
and this is why f R has the highest weight in the cardiac arrest prediction model developed by Churpek
et al. [2]. In this model, progressively higher scores are attributed to f R values > 20 breaths/min,
with the highest score assigned to values > 29 breaths/min [2]. Likewise, Fieselmann et al. [48] found
> 27 breaths/min was a better predictor of cardiopulmonary arrest compared to the heart
that an f R
rate and blood pressure in internal medicine inpatients, and other f R thresholds were also predictive
of cardiopulmonary arrest. The rise in resting f R is observed hours before the occurrence of cardiac
arrest [48,50,51], thus suggesting that f R monitoring may help in the early detection and management
of adverse cardiac events [1]. The prognostic power of f R was also documented in patients with
acute myocardial infarction, where f R was found to be an independent predictor of the post-treatment
outcome, with a doubling of mortality for every four-breath increment in f R [52]. Furthermore,
a study involving more than 900 patients with acute myocardial infarction found that nocturnal f R
(cut-oﬀ value > 18.6 breaths/min) was a good predictor of non-sudden cardiac death [53,54]. Likewise,
≥ 16 breaths/min was found to be an independent predictor of long-term cardiovascular
a nocturnal f R
mortality in older adults [55]. The importance of these ﬁndings is not conﬁned to healthcare settings
but extends to in-home monitoring of patients at risk. Indeed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a leading
cause of cardiac death worldwide [56], and respiratory monitoring may aid the prediction or early
management of such an event [57]. However, f R is still poorly recorded in healthcare [29,38,58–60],
despite substantial evidence of its clinical relevance. This contrasts with the ever-growing increase in
technological development observed in the ﬁeld of respiratory monitoring in the last years [23–26].
Therefore, we urge the improvement of respiratory monitoring services to help reduce the incidence of
cardiac arrest and to lower the associated morbidity and mortality.

2.2.2. Measurement and Computing

Prevention of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a vital monitoring goal for patients at risk.
These patients may require continuous monitoring during everyday life and would beneﬁt from vital
sign measurement through wearable devices. Here, we present some techniques suitable to monitor
f R in a real-life scenario. Several technological solutions are currently available for the continuous
monitoring of the ECG signal, including standard Holter devices, and sensors integrated into patches
or garments [61]. When cardiopathic patients wear a device measuring ECG, it is tempting to extract
f R from this signal or to use ECG electrodes to measure f R via impedance plethysmography. These two
solutions have been commonly employed for respiratory monitoring, leveraging on the fact that
no extra device is needed. The morphology of ECG is aﬀected by breathing, which determines the
amplitude, frequency, and baseline modulations of this signal [62]. The estimation of f R from the
ECG has proven to be successful in speciﬁc measurement scenarios, especially during nocturnal
recording [53,54]. f R estimated from the ECG of a Holter device was found to be a good predictor
of non-sudden cardiac death, and this association was not substantially inﬂuenced by the number
of ECG leads [53,54]. The same study showed good agreement between f R derived from ECG and
that measured with a piezoelectric sensor, but only when calculating the local maxima of diﬀerent
ECG-derived respiratory time series and not when using spectral analysis [54]. This suggests that
the choice of the algorithm to process the ECG signal is critical. The nocturnal measurement of f R
from ECG was found to be suitable also in patients with sleep apnea [63]. Sleep monitoring for
cardiopathic patients may also beneﬁt from the recording of breathing sounds to assess the presence
of agonal breathing, which is a frequent but under-appreciated diagnostic sign of cardiac arrest [57].
Machine learning algorithms have been developed to classify agonal breathing instances in real-time

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

7 of 46

within a bedroom environment, with simulations showing a sensitivity of 97.24% and a speciﬁcity of
99.51% [57].

The estimation of f R from ECG may present some problems during everyday-life activities.
Indeed, the error in f R estimation was found to be higher during a driving task compared to sleep,
and increased for f R values outside of the 0.1 Hz–0.4 Hz range [63]. An alternative approach is
impedance plethysmography, where the ECG electrodes are used to detect respiratory-induced changes
in thoracic impedance [24]. However, impedance plethysmography usually underperforms compared
to techniques measuring respiration-related chest wall movements with strain sensors. This has
been shown in diﬀerent conditions, including exercise, ambulatory monitoring, and drug-induced
respiratory depression [24,64,65]. Strain sensors (e.g., resistive, capacitive, and inductive sensors) may
be suitable solutions to register the respiration-induced movements of the thorax or the abdomen and
measure f R continuously [24]. These techniques can provide real-time streaming of data for remote
processing and visualization thanks to small electronics and connectivity capabilities [66].

Breath-by-breath f R monitoring may not be strictly required for cardiopathic patients performing
activities of daily life, and average f R values over 60 s are suﬃcient in most cases. Conversely,
the detection of agonal breathing requires the processing of the raw respiratory signal with machine
learning algorithms [57].

2.3. Apnea

2.3.1. Current Evidence

Sleep apnea is a serious breathing disorder associated with major neurocognitive and
cardiovascular sequelae [67]. A causal relationship has been found between sleep apnea and the
incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, stroke, and heart
failure [68]. Furthermore, sleep apnea is associated with poor sleep quality, daytime fatigue, sleepiness,
neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., cognitive impairment and depression), and impairments in the quality
of life [69,70]. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of apnea. It aﬀects almost
1 billion people worldwide and its prevalence exceeds 50% in some countries [67]. Obesity is the
major risk factor for OSA, but 20% to 40% of OSA patients are not obese [68]. Apnea events are
diﬀerentiated from hypopnea events but both types concur to the computation of the Apnea-Hypopnea
Index (AHI), which describes the severity of the disease [71]. An apnea event occurs when the
airﬂow is absent or nearly absent (drop by ≥90% of pre-event baseline respiration) for at least 10 s,
while hypopnea consists in a respiratory drop by at least 30% of pre-event baseline respiration for
at least 10 s [71]. Hence, hypopnea detection requires the measurement or estimation of airﬂow
(both f R and tidal volume) [71]. The concomitant use of diﬀerent sensors is needed for the diﬀerential
diagnosis of OSA, central sleep apnea (CSA), or mixed sleep apnea, and diﬀerent guidelines have
been provided for children and adults [71]. However, most cases of obstructive sleep apnea remain
undiagnosed and untreated, even in developed countries [67]. This is partially due to the laborious
procedures required for the diagnostic testing of sleep apnea, which is usually performed overnight
in sleep laboratories, involves high costs, and is uncomfortable for patients [72]. Hence, there is
a growing interest in the development of cost-eﬀective, noninvasive, and user-friendly solutions
for the preliminary identiﬁcation of sleep disorders or the home-monitoring of patients with sleep
apnea [72,73].
Indeed, the timely diagnosis of sleep apnea and recognition of exacerbations can
decrease morbidity, mortality, and the economic burden for healthcare systems. f R monitoring plays
an important role in achieving these goals.

2.3.2. Measurement and Computing

The choice of measurement techniques for sleep apnea detection depends on speciﬁc monitoring
goals and scenarios. Here, we describe some of the techniques used for: (1) diagnostic testing in
sleep laboratories; (2) home sleep apnea testing; and (3) home monitoring. Diagnostic testing in

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

8 of 46

patients suspected of having sleep apnea (polysomnography) is usually conducted overnight in
sleep laboratories. The diﬀerentiation between OSA and CSA requires the simultaneous use of
diﬀerent sensors because the recording of chest and abdomen movements is required along with apnea
identiﬁcation. When these movements are present (i.e., the so-called “respiratory eﬀort” is observed),
the patient is diagnosed with OSA; otherwise, with CSA. Speciﬁc guidelines describe the measurement
techniques needed as diagnostic tools for sleep apnea identiﬁcation [71]. Apnea and hypopnea
events are identiﬁed with the concomitant use of nasal pressure sensors and oronasal temperature
sensors. Nasal pressure sensors provide a signal proportional to the square wave of the airﬂow and are
sensitive to even subtle changes in airﬂow [71], although their sensitivity is higher at high ﬂow rates
compared to low ﬂow rates. However, they may fail to detect or estimate oral airﬂow. This limitation
is overcome with the simultaneous use of oronasal temperature sensors. These sensors (i.e., thermistor,
thermocouples, pyroelectric and ﬁber optic sensors) show low obtrusiveness (a few millimeters in
diameter), good response time (from some ms up to some seconds), and a high sensitivity to airﬂow in
the temperature range of interest for respiratory monitoring [24]. On the other hand, the signal from
temperature sensors is not proportional to the airﬂow, which determines an overestimation of low ﬂow
rates and an underdetection of hypopnea events [71,74]. While not considered by current guidelines,
humidity sensors may provide a valid alternative to temperature sensors. Indeed, miniaturized relative
humidity sensors (typically embedding nanocrystals and nanoparticles) exploit the water vapor
diﬀerences between inhaled and exhaled air and are characterized by excellent response time (order of
40 ms) [24]. Besides, unobtrusive solutions based on hot-wire anemometers for direct oral/nasal airﬂow
detection are promising and deserve consideration [75]. While apnea is usually detected with nasal
pressure sensors and oronasal temperature sensors, the use of respiratory inductive plethysmography
(RIP) (consisting of two belts positioned at the thorax and abdomen levels) or polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
sensors is recommended for “respiratory eﬀort” detection [71]. However, other technologies based
on conductive sensors (i.e., piezoresistive, piezoconductive, and capacitive sensors) are suitable for
“respiratory eﬀort” detection and should be considered in future guidelines. These sensors have
been extensively reviewed by Massaroni et al. [24] and can be integrated into garments, belts, straps,
and patches. One of the open challenges in the diagnostic testing of sleep apnea is the identiﬁcation of
hypopnea events, as the use of diﬀerent criteria and sensors may result in marked diﬀerences in AHI
values [76,77], with important implications for disease identiﬁcation, severity grading, and clinical
decision making.

A hot topic in sleep apnea research is the development of home sleep apnea testing procedures
for the out-of-lab diagnosis, which requires the identiﬁcation and use of less obtrusive solutions.
Among the proposed technologies, tracheal sound measurement is a sensitive, reliable, and noninvasive
technique [78–80]. When a microphone is placed at the suprasternal notch, tracheal sounds eﬀectively
detect sleep apnea events, even those missed by nasal pressure sensors due to mouth breathing or nose
obstruction [79]. Hence, tracheal sound sensors meet the oronasal ﬂow evaluation criteria for apnea
detection required by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and can thus be used as alternatives
to temperature sensors [79,80]. Furthermore, these sensors can provide additional useful information
on snoring sounds and sleep/wake status discrimination [78,81].

Acoustic sensors can also be used in home settings when the aim is not to perform a diagnostic
test for sleep apnea identiﬁcation but to monitor the patient on a routine basis. To this end, sleep apnea
can be detected with a mobile phone built-in microphone [81,82]. Other available techniques for apnea
monitoring include the use of camera sensors for the recording of surveillance videos that can be
post-processed to retrieve apnea episodes [83,84]. Besides, techniques based on instrumented items
(e.g., sleep mats) have also been designed and tested, but further research is needed to improve their
sensitivity to sleep apnea detection [85]. In patients with cardiac implants, Defaye et al. [86] provided
a valid solution for night-to-night apnea monitoring using an implantable transthoracic impedance
sensor. They observed a sensitivity of 100% and a speciﬁcity of 80% for sleep apnea and hypopnea
detection, with important implications for the clinical management of this patient population [86].

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

Apnea detection requires the acquisition and storage of raw respiratory data because manual
scoring is often performed [87]. On the other hand, several computing techniques have been used for
the automatic detection of apnea, hypopnea, and related scores, including amplitude and adaptive
thresholding, linear and kernel methods, tree based models, artiﬁcial neural networks, deep learning,
and fuzzy logic systems and networks [87].

2.4. Pneumonia

2.4.1. Current Evidence

Pneumonia is a leading cause of post-neonatal death in children under-ﬁve years [3,88]. The World
Health Organization guidelines suggest that f R should be integral to the pneumonia diagnostic
pathway [3,88], especially in low- and middle-income countries, where timely pneumonia diagnosis
is a much greater challenge because of limited resources [88]. This issue is of great relevance,
considering that childhood pneumonia deaths could be prevented with simple interventions and
appropriate treatments [89]. f R cut-oﬀ values for severe pneumonia correspond to ≥60 breaths/min,
≥50 breaths/min, and ≥40 breaths/min for children who are <2 months of age, between 2 months
and 11 months, and between 12 and 59 months of age, respectively [3]. Pneumonia is a serious
infectious disease for other populations as well, including older adults [90,91] and patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [92]. Furthermore, pneumonia outbreaks, as the pandemic caused by
the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19 disease), constitute major medical, social, and economic challenges
worldwide [93]. f R monitoring may prove to be of great value in these circumstances, given the clinical
relevance of f R in the diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of COVID-19 [5]. Given the
fact that f R is altered substantially by pneumonia, f R is among the variables used to deﬁne criteria
for the diagnosis of severe pneumonia (≥30 breaths/min) and for the achievement of clinical stability
(≤24 breaths/min) [94,95]. A large body of evidence suggests that f R is an important prognostic marker
and a predictor of mortality in patients with pneumonia [95–98], but not all the studies entirely support
this notion [90,99]. Diﬀerent ﬁndings between studies may be partially due to the fact that f R is too
often not accurately measured in the context of pneumonia [5,88,89,100]. Given the clinical relevance
of f R for the management of this disease, it is essential to use accurate systems for f R measurement.

2.4.2. Measurement and Computing

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly increased awareness of the importance of eﬀective respiratory
monitoring [5,101], which is an unprecedented opportunity to solve long-standing issues related to
f R monitoring in the context of pneumonia. Here, we focus on the measurement techniques suitable
for pneumonia monitoring in children, a condition presenting some peculiar challenges, including
high resting f R values (especially in newborn babies) and the possible presence of artifacts in the
respiratory signal due to movement and crying. A particularly relevant measurement scenario is that
of pre-hospital settings in low-income countries, where the aﬀordability of measurement systems and
their simplicity of use are additional factors to take into account [88]. Methodological inconsistencies
across studies have so far resulted in diﬃculties in the identiﬁcation of suitable techniques to measure
f R in such a scenario [89,100]. Despite the important limitations of manual counting [88], this is still
a commonly used method to measure f R and is even selected as a reference method for validation
studies [89]. Indeed, the choice of the reference system is a critical problem, as highlighted by a recent
systematic review on the technological solutions available to measure f R for pneumonia identiﬁcation
in children [89]. The authors reported great heterogeneity in the selection of reference systems,
which may impact on the quality of some of the reviewed studies and limit the possibility to compare
the performances of techniques tested in diﬀerent studies [89]. Nevertheless, some contactless solutions
appear promising [89]. Some of these technologies measure f R from the detection of respiration-induced
body movements, including depth sensors, radiofrequency sensors, and RGB (red, green, blue) camera
sensors [23,102–104]. When the respiratory waveform is obtained from video image recordings,

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

10 of 46

magniﬁcation algorithms can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when small
movements of the chest wall are observed [102]. Alternatively, solutions based on the use of pressure
or strain sensors embedded in mattresses or other bed components can be used to obtain accurate f R
values [105]. All these techniques are relatively cheap and can prove useful in non-collaborative subjects
like newborns and children, with no need to attach sensors on the patient’s body. Thermal cameras
and laser vibrometry sensors are other interesting solutions for the contactless monitoring of newborns
in clinical scenarios [44,106], but their cost is relatively high [23]. On the other hand, contact-based
solutions such as nasal pressure sensors, oronasal thermistors, and impedance plethysmography are
currently used as diagnostic tools for sleep apnea in children [107]. These are suitable techniques for
continuous f R monitoring but are not practical for routine vital sign monitoring of patients suspected
with pneumonia, especially in low-income countries.

Breath-by-breath f R monitoring is not strictly needed in this context, and current UNICEF
guidelines on diagnostic aids for acute respiratory infection require accuracy of ±2 breath/min over a
recording period of 60 s [89]. While a series of contact-based and contactless techniques fulﬁll this
requirement [23,24], so far their development and use have been limited by inadequate consideration
of the speciﬁc needs of children living in low-income countries [89].

2.5. Clinical Deterioration

2.5.1. Current Evidence

Evidence suggests that f R is an important marker of clinical deterioration for a variety of
pathological conditions in both adults [4,108–110] and children [111]. Indeed, f R is a fundamental
variable included in the majority of prognostic scores developed for the prediction of diﬀerent outcomes,
including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality [4,109,110]. As such, f R contributes to
the computation of the most accurate prognostic scores developed so far, such as the National Early
Warning Score (NEWS) and the Modiﬁed Early Warning Score (MEWS) [4]. The NEWS assigns a score
to f R values outside of the 12–20 breaths/min range, with the highest score attributed to f R values ≤8 and
≥25 breaths/min [112], while the highest score for MEWS is attributed to f R values ≥30 breaths/min [113].
A modiﬁed version of NEWS (i.e., NEWS2) has shown a good predictive capacity for the identiﬁcation of
in-hospital early mortality (all-cause) even when vital signs were collected at pre-hospital level, with f R
showing lower values in survivors compared to non-survivors [114]. f R is also among the signs used
≥ 16 breaths/min is an independent
for sepsis identiﬁcation [115–117]. Furthermore, a nocturnal f R
predictor of long-term all-cause mortality [55]. A further increase in the accuracy of early warning scores
is expected with measures performed at diﬀerent time points as opposed to single measures [116,118],
thus requiring devices to collect vital signs on a periodic or even continuous basis. This is important
for timely critical care assistance because f R may increase several hours before the occurrence of an
adverse event [4,118,119], and such f R changes should be promptly identiﬁed. However, despite the
clinical relevance of f R, this vital sign is often under-recorded [29,37,120,121] or not measured
accurately [38,59,60,122–124]. This may impair the eﬃcacy of early warning scores [118,120,121],
which also suﬀer from other methodological issues [109,110]. Therefore, it is imperative to improve
the accuracy and frequency of f R monitoring throughout the healthcare chain (pre-hospital, hospital,
and post-hospital).

2.5.2. Measurement and Computing

Vital signs are commonly measured during hospital admission at triage. However, f R is measured
by manual counting or is still too often not recorded at all [37,59,60,121]. The important limitations of
this current practice have been discussed elsewhere [29,58–60,122–125]. This section presents some of
the suitable techniques to measure f R at hospital admission, with special attention to those allowing for
periodic or even continuous monitoring of the patients needing hospital recovery. The extraction of f R
from the PPG signal is a practical solution as this signal is obtained from the pulse oximeter, which is

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

11 of 46

routinely used in clinical settings to measure peripheral arterial blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.
The pulse oximeter is usually applied at the ﬁnger (but also other locations can be used), is non-invasive,
easy to use, and is suitable for the continuous monitoring of patients requiring special care. f R can be
extracted from the PPG signal because breathing aﬀects this signal by determining the phenomena of
baseline wander, amplitude modulation, and frequency modulation [62]. However, the occurrence
of these phenomena depends on diﬀerent factors, including breathing patterns, ﬁnger perfusion,
health conditions, and body position [62]. This makes f R estimation challenging and explains why a
great body of research in this area is focused on the identiﬁcation of computing solutions to improve
the estimation of f R. A plethora of algorithms have been developed for the extraction and fusion
of respiratory signals, for f R estimation, for the fusion of f R values obtained from diﬀerent signals,
and for quality assessment [62,126]. Given the indirect nature of f R estimation from PPG, signal quality
assessment is an important process requiring the assessment of both PPG signal quality and respiratory
quality indices [62]. Indeed, the accuracy of f R measurement is not only dependent on the quality of
the PPG signal but also on the extent of breathing modulation.

Despite extensive research in this area, the implementation of algorithms estimating f R from PPG
is still not common in commercial devices. One of the exceptions is the NellcorTM Respiratory Rate
Software application (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland), which showed a good performance when tested in
hospitalized patients against the capnography reference method (Mean of diﬀerence, MOD ± Limits
of agreement, LOAs, 0.07 ± 3.90 breaths/min) [127]. Conversely, lower performances were found in
the challenging measurement scenario of patients undergoing sedation and analgesia for endoscopy
procedures, with a substantial diﬀerence observed between the f R estimated from PPG with the
NellcorTM 2.0 monitoring system (Covidien, Mansﬁeld, MA, USA) and that obtained from capnography
(MOD ± LOAs, 2.25 ± 10.60 breaths/min) [128]. Cardiac arrhythmias may also aﬀect the physiological
mechanisms responsible for the respiratory modulation of the PPG signal, and thus the quality of
f R measurement [62]. Nonetheless, the implementation of algorithms extracting f R into commercial
devices opens important avenues for f R monitoring in clinical settings.

The current limitations of f R measurement from PPG suggest that other techniques may
complement the use of PPG devices at hospital triage. Contactless techniques have some practical
advantages over contact-based techniques in this scenario, where the vital signs of several patients
need to be recorded over a short period of time. Contactless techniques avoid the problem of
sanitizing the measurement device after each use and generally make the patient less aware of
the measurement, which matters because measurement awareness aﬀects f R values at rest [60].
Diﬀerent sensors registering respiration-induced body movements can be suitable for this purpose,
including depth sensors, camera-based sensors and radiofrequency sensors [23]. Depth sensors
(e.g., Time-of-Flight sensors) are commercially available (e.g., Microsoft Kinect v2, Microsoft Corp.,
Redmond, WA, USA), provide an accurate measure of f R when the patient is seated [129], and are less
inﬂuenced by environmental factors (e.g., ambient light) compared to other contactless techniques [23].
Camera-based sensors and radiofrequency sensors (radar sensors and WiFi sensors) also show relatively
good performances when measuring f R in resting patients [130–132], and can be used to monitor
diﬀerent patients simultaneously [23]. However, further research is needed to assess the suitability of
contactless sensors for f R monitoring in hospital settings.

For patients needing hospital recovery, contact-based solutions allowing for continuous monitoring
during a hospital stay may prove suitable, and some commercial devices have been developed for
this purpose. Subbe and Kinsella [133] have assessed the validity of a wearable commercial device
(RespiraSense™, PMD Solutions, Cork, Ireland) in patients admitted to the hospital as medical
emergencies. This device measures respiration-related movements through a piezoelectric array
located at the lower thorax level. On-board accelerometers and algorithms allow for the detection and
partial removal of artifacts such as cough, speech, and motion artifact [133]. RespiraSense™ showed
good accuracy when f R (recorded over 15 min periods) was compared to capnography derived f R [133].

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

This system can be worn for some hours and may increase the robustness of f R measurement by
selecting suitable (e.g., without motion artifacts) and multiple portions of the registered signal [133].
Two other FDA-approved wearable devices have been tested for validity, feasibility, and usability
in patients admitted to the hospital and transferred to the general ward [118,134]. The ViSi Mobile
system (Sotera Wireless, San Diego, CA, USA) measures f R with impedance sensors attached on
the chest [118,134], while the HealthPatch (Vital Connect, Campbell, CA, USA) is a disposable
adhesive patch with reusable sensors, and extracts f R from the ECG signal and the accelerometer
signal [118,134]. Both devices were successfully used for the continuous monitoring of patients over
2–3 days of hospitalization, but the accuracy of f R measurement was only tested against manual
counting performed by nurses [118,134]. The discrepancy found between the f R values measured with
the ViSi Mobile and the HealthPatch and those collected by nurses impacted the computation of the
MEWS [118,134], thus requiring further validation of the devices against an objective reference system.
Use in real clinical settings also highlighted problems with connectivity, data loss, and artifacts aﬀecting
the signal [118,134], which requires consideration of the improvement and development of respiratory
systems for patient monitoring in hospitals. The advantage of these techniques is the possibility to
monitor the patient continuously throughout the healthcare chain, which greatly outperforms the
current approach of manual counting over 60 s or even shorter periods of time [60]. However, more
research is needed to improve the accuracy and suitability of respiratory devices for the assessment of
clinical deterioration.

2.6. Dyspnea

2.6.1. Current Evidence

Among the factors accounting for f R being a marker of clinical deterioration, the association
between f R and dyspnea deserves consideration. Dyspnea is a major symptom in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other cardiorespiratory diseases [135,136], in obese
individuals [137], and in older adults [138]. Furthermore, it is a major determinant of exercise
intolerance and sedentary behavior in these populations, with consequent impairments in function
and quality of life [135,137–139]. While dyspnea is a sensation of breathlessness (i.e., a symptom),
an increase in resting f R is its major physiological sign [140]. An association between f R and dyspnea
is observed both at rest and during physical exercise. At hospital admission, the resting f R of
patients admitted with dyspnea contributes to predicting the occurrence of diﬀerent clinical outcomes,
i.e., the use of non-invasive ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality [121]. The sensitivity of resting
f R as a predictor of COPD exacerbations is corroborated by ﬁndings from several studies [136,141–143],
and is of paramount importance for the early detection and treatment of these adverse events. During
exercise, a close association between f R and dyspnea is observed in patients with diﬀerent respiratory
diseases, as similar responses are observed in patients with COPD and in those with interstitial lung
disease [18].

Importantly, a neurophysiological link between dyspnea and f R is evident because they are both
regulated, at least to some extent, by the activity of areas of the brain relating to motor control, volition,
cognition, and emotion processing [11,21,22,144–146]. On the other hand, dyspnea is a multidimensional
sensation composed of three respiratory sensations with somewhat diﬀerent underlying mechanisms
and signs, i.e., respiratory eﬀort, air anger, and chest tightness [145]. For instance, air anger is at
least partially regulated by the magnitude of chemoreceptor aﬀerent activity [147], and may thus be
associated with a predominant increase in VT [19,22,147]. An emblematic example is the air hunger
associated with the deep and regular breathing observed in patients with metabolic acidosis, which is
known as the “Kussmaul’s sign” [148]. Conversely, respiratory eﬀort is at least partially regulated by
the central motor drive to the locomotor and respiratory muscles (i.e., central command) [145,147],
and may thus determine a predominant increase in f R [13,22]. Given that patients present with various
combinations of the afore-mentioned respiratory sensations [147], the monitoring of f R and VT may

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

13 of 46

help shed some light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dyspnea. As such, respiratory
monitoring plays a fundamental role in the detection and management of dyspnea.

2.6.2. Measurement and Computing

The assessment of the signs of dyspnea (e.g., an increase in f R) is particularly relevant during
daily life activities (e.g., walking and stair climbing) where this symptom is exacerbated [149].
Here, we present some suitable measurement techniques for respiratory monitoring in this scenario.
The need to monitor f R during daily life requires the simultaneous identiﬁcation of the activities
performed by the patient [27]. Indeed, the severity of dyspnea is better described if the levels of f R are
interpreted along with the intensity and type of the physical tasks performed [149]. This information
can be obtained from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors [27]. When located in speciﬁc parts of
the trunk, IMU sensors may also be used to estimate both f R and the respiratory amplitude [150–152].
By positioning accelerometers on the thorax and the abdomen, Fekr et al. [151] found that the use
of a robust classiﬁcation algorithm was suitable for the identiﬁcation of eight diﬀerent pathological
breathing patterns, including the Kussmaul’s sign. However, the quality of the respiratory signal
obtained from IMU sensors is largely aﬀected by motion artifacts during physical activities [24]. On the
other hand, IMU sensors can be used to improve the quality of the respiratory signal obtained with other
sensors (e.g., strain sensors), through motion artifact identiﬁcation and removal [24]. Therefore, it is
preferable to complement the use of IMU sensors with other techniques for respiratory monitoring [24].
Strain sensors embedded into garments may prove particularly useful to measure f R in patients
with dyspnea, with a preference for those allowing for the estimation of VT (or the respiratory
amplitude as a surrogate) [24,153]. A smart garment designed for measuring physiological signs of
dyspnea would beneﬁt from the integration of strain sensors situated in speciﬁc locations of the trunk.
Indeed, sensor redundancy improves the accuracy of f R and VT measurements [24,153,154], and may
help detect other signs observed in patients with dyspnea such as the temporal thoracoabdominal
asynchrony between the movements of the thoracic and abdominal compartments [155,156].
Thoracoabdominal asynchrony is often computed by means of the phase angle analysis, is higher
during exercise compared to rest, and increases with exercise intensity [155]. Respiratory inductive
plethysmography is a classical technique used to compute thoracoabdominal asynchrony with
wearable sensors, and consists of two elastic cloth bands containing insulated wires encircling the rib
cage and the abdomen [24]. Similar performances were found when comparing thoracoabdominal
asynchrony measured with RIP and optoelectronic plethysmography (the reference system for
measuring compartmental volumes [156]) in healthy individuals and patients with COPD and
interstitial lung disease [155]. However, the agreement between the two techniques was higher at rest
and during moderate exercise compared to heavy exercise, where a wide variability in the phase angle
was observed [155].

Capacitive and resistive sensors also have metrological characteristics that are suitable for
monitoring patients with dyspnea [24]. Naranjo-Hernández et al. [157] tested the feasibility of
a remote respiratory service for monitoring the f R of COPD patients during the recovery from
home-based exercises. The measuring system was a smart vest embedding capacitive sensors,
which showed superior performances (MOD ± LOAs, −0.14 ± 0.54 breaths/min) compared to those of
some other measuring systems validated in the literature [157]. However, the authors did not assess
the performances of the system during exercise, which is an important requirement for f R monitoring
in COPD patients and other patients presenting with dyspnea. Chu et al. [153] reported the good
performance of small wearable piezo-resistive strain sensors situated at the level of the ribcage and
the abdomen when f R and VT were compared with the same variables obtained with a spirometer.
The wearable system was tested at rest and during ambulatory conditions, with interesting implications
for the remote monitoring of patients with dyspnea [153]. However, the system was only tested on
healthy individuals, and the respiratory signals were aﬀected by motion artifacts (e.g., torsion of

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

14 of 46

the trunk) during walking. Further research should focus on the development of wearable systems
speciﬁcally designed for patients with dyspnea performing daily-life activities.

High-quality respiratory waveforms are needed to compute thoracoabdominal asynchrony and
compartmental volumes. As such, it is preferable that respiratory systems measuring f R in patients
with dyspnea are validated on a breath-by-breath basis.

2.7. Pain

2.7.1. Current Evidence

Pain is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide [158]. For instance, pain is a major healthcare issue
in postoperative patients [159] and a common problem in patients requiring emergency medical service
assistance [160,161]. It is well-established that pain inﬂuences breathing and generally determines an
increase in minute ventilation [7,162]. This eﬀect is mediated by an increase in f R, VT, or both, depending
on the nature of the painful stimulus [7,162]. The hormonal stress response which accompanies acute
pain induces a predominant increase in VT [163], while the psycho-behavioral changes induced by
pain (e.g., discomfort, fear, and displeasure) aﬀect f R more. An example is the increase in f R that occurs
with the anticipation of pain before the advent of the nociceptive stimulus [164]. The stimulation of
nociceptive aﬀerents leads to a predominant increase in f R, which is documented by the elevated f R
observed in surgical patients under anesthesia [7].

In a cohort of over 50.000 patients with acute pain, Bendall et al. [165] found that an
> 25 breaths/min was the most important predictor of pain severity compared to other vital
f R
signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. Likewise, among diﬀerent vital signs, f R showed the
strongest association with the severity of pain in over 18.000 patients requiring prehospital emergency
medical service assistance due to pain [160]. It is also of note that f R decreases with the administration
of commonly used pain drugs (i.e., opioids), which makes f R monitoring important to alert when the
patient is at risk of respiratory depression [166], more so than arterial oxygen saturation measured
by pulse oximetry [167]. This matters because opioid-related death is among the major causes of
accidental mortality in adults [161], and brain damage may also occur [166]. Respiratory monitoring is
also useful for the evaluation of pain in nonverbal critically ill patients or infants [162,168,169]. On the
other hand, breathing may aﬀect pain; several clinical and laboratory studies have reported a beneﬁcial
eﬀect of slow deep breathing on pain [162]. Slow deep breathing may decrease pain perception
through respiratory-induced cardiovascular/autonomic changes (e.g., respiratory sinus arrhythmia
and variations in baroreﬂex activity), the modulation of cortical activity, and psycho-behavioral
factors [162,170,171]. The eﬀect of slow breathing on pain may improve with the use of respiratory
biofeedback strategies [162,172]. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that respiratory monitoring is of
great importance for pain detection and management.

2.7.2. Measurement and Computing

A typical scenario where f R can be used as a marker of pain is in postoperative patients.
In this context, the main measuring challenge is the detection of respiratory depression, which may
occur as a side eﬀect of the administration of pain drugs (i.e., opioids), especially within 24 h
of surgery [65,166]. Ermer et al. [65] conducted an interesting study speciﬁcally targeting the
identiﬁcation of suitable sensors capable of detecting f R values below 10 breaths/min in sedated
volunteers. Some methodological limitations of the study require caution in the interpretation of their
ﬁndings, but useful information for further research have been provided [65]. The authors found that an
abdominal accelerometer and a capnometer showed better performances compared to a nasal pressure
transducer, an oronasal thermistor, a peritracheal microphone, transthoracic impedance sensors,
and photoplethysmography [65]. The last two techniques listed showed the worst performances [65].
However, the sensors were validated against RIP, which may not be an ideal reference technique.
This may partly explain the superior performances of the abdominal accelerometer, which was

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

15 of 46

positioned in the same location of the abdominal RIP belt. Besides, a microphone may estimate f R more
eﬀectively when located on the suprasternal notch [79] compared to a peritracheal location [65],
and thermistors may underperform compared to other temperature sensors (e.g., pyroelectric
sensors) [24]. Another possible limitation of the study is the use of the same algorithm to compare
the performances of the diﬀerent waveforms acquired with the various sensors [65].
In another
study, the authors used the same data set to test the eﬃcacy of a machine-learning algorithm in the
identiﬁcation of ataxic breathing severity, using breath-by-breath data of f R and VT collected with the
RIP sensors and the nasal pressure sensor [173]. Given that alterations in ventilatory variability are
commonly observed under the eﬀect of opioids [173,174], the good performances of the support vector
machine classiﬁer tested by Elmer at al. [173] provide interesting perspectives on the identiﬁcation
of drug-induced irregular breathing. However, these ﬁndings [65,173] may not directly translate to
everyday pain assessment as volunteers were asked not to talk or move and were monitored for
relatively short periods of time, while postoperative patients require continuous monitoring [166,175].
Nonetheless, the study by Elmer et al. [65] highlights the importance of validating diﬀerent sensors
in a situation that resembles some of the characteristics of the measurement scenario of interest
(i.e., opioid-induced respiratory depression).

While all the sensors tested by Ermer et al. [65] require direct contact with the patient’s body,
less obtrusive techniques may also prove useful for the continuous monitoring of the f R of patients
suﬀering from pain. Isono et al. [176] tested an interesting solution for estimating f R with four load
cells placed under a medical bed. f R was estimated by measuring the centroid shift in the cranio-caudal
direction caused by the respiratory-related movements of the visceral organs. Accurate values of f R
were obtained in the range of 4 breaths/min to 40 breaths/min in diﬀerent body positions, while f R was
underestimated above 40 breaths/min [176]. A similar solution with load cells under the bed proved
valid for the estimation of apnea (100% sensitivity and 97% speciﬁcity) and hypopnea events [177],
which makes this application suitable for respiratory depression detection. While non-respiratory
movements may negatively aﬀect the estimation of f R, the use of load cells facilitates the identiﬁcation
of movement artifacts.

Given the importance of detecting respiratory depression and irregular breathing induced by
opioids, breath-by-breath monitoring of f R and VT is advised, although rarely performed, in the current
clinical practice. Breath-by-breath monitoring and validation are also important requirements when
measurement systems are used to alleviate pain through respiratory biofeedback. On the other hand,
average f R values over 60 s may provide suﬃcient information for the assessment of the pain-induced
increase in f R. Along this line, the American Society of Pain Management Nursing Guidelines require
that “respirations should be counted for a full minute and qualiﬁed according to rhythm and depth of
chest excursion while the patient is in a restful/sleep state in a quiet unstimulated environment” [178].

2.8. Emotional Stress

2.8.1. Current Evidence

It is well established that emotions aﬀect ventilation, with a preferential inﬂuence exerted on
f R rather than VT [8]. This is not surprising considering that f R has been deﬁned as the behavioral
component of minute ventilation [19,20,22]. f R increases with experimentally-induced anticipatory
anxiety, unlike VT, oxygen uptake or carbon dioxide output [179]. This increase in f R is positively
related to individual trait anxiety scores [179]. Besides, f R is sensitive to changes in aﬀective valence
and arousal [180]. This makes f R a good candidate to identify emotional states in a variety of conditions
and populations. For instance, f R increases during panic attacks [7,181] and may discriminate between
diﬀerent pathological conditions; it is higher in patients with panic disorder compared to those
with social phobia [182]. The fact that f R is a good marker of emotional stress can be attributed
to the fact that f R is partially regulated by the activity of areas of the brain involved in emotional
processing [8,183]. Indeed, direct stimulation of the amygdala produces a rapid increase in f R [8].

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

16 of 46

On the other hand, the pattern of breathing inﬂuences emotions since voluntary breathing techniques
(e.g., slow deep breathing) may attenuate negative emotional states [184]. Hence, the understanding of
the interrelationship between breathing and emotions is fundamental to provide insight on how to
treat anxiety, stress, depression, and emotional disorders [184].

2.8.2. Measurement and Computing

When respiratory monitoring is purported to detect emotional stress, unobtrusiveness is
an important requirement for the choice of the technique, as measurement awareness and
obtrusive technologies may aﬀect the individual emotional state and ventilatory responses [24,60].
Here, we present two measurement scenarios: (1) emotion recognition in the laboratory; (2) emotional
In research laboratories, f R is among the signs that may help
stress detection in everyday life.
recognize and classify emotions, along with heart rate, heart rate variability, galvanic skin response,
body temperature, body posture, and facial expressions [180,185,186]. Contactless techniques are
suitable for monitoring f R in this scenario, and the use of techniques that can simultaneously record
other relevant signals is particularly valuable. For instance, a thermal camera can be used to retrieve
f R and detect facial expressions at the same time from thermal video frames [187,188]. With this
technique, f R estimation is performed by analyzing respiration-induced changes in pixel intensity in a
speciﬁc region of interest (at the level of the nose or mouth) [187]. However, the post-processing of
video images is generally time consuming when compared to the majority of contact-based techniques,
and infrared video images are usually analyzed after data collection. Other contactless sensors that
can simultaneously register f R, face expressions and cardiovascular variables are RGB camera sensors
and depth sensors [23,189,190]. When the area of the upper chest is ﬁlmed, RGB camera sensors can be
used to retrieve respiration-induced body movements from the post-processing of video images [132].
Alternatively, if the face of the user is recorded with a camera, RGB camera sensors can be used to
extract f R from the modulation of the video PPG signal [189].

The understanding of the interrelationship between breathing and emotions depends on
the accurate characterization of a number of respiratory features that can be extracted from the
respiratory waveform [191,192]. Noto et al. [192] developed an open-source tool box (BreathMetrics)
that automatically extracts a number of meaningful features embedded in human nasal airﬂow
recordings. These include f R, VT, inspiratory and expiratory time, and inspiratory and expiratory
pauses [192]. The use of the nasal ﬂow measure was dictated by the close link between nasal
ﬂow and the activity of olfactory and limbic areas of the brain, but the authors are also trying to
extend BreathMetrics functionality to respiratory waveforms obtained from sensors measuring the
movements of the chest wall [192]. This would favor the recording of some important respiratory
features in real-life scenarios. For instance, the possibility to record sigh events and ventilatory
variability may further our understanding of the ventilatory response to emotional stressors [191].
Indeed, sighs and ventilatory variability are important elements in the regulation of breathing and
emotions, with implications for the management of emotional stress and the prescription of therapeutic
interventions in diﬀerent diseases [191]. The respiratory waveform can also be analyzed with deep
learning emotion recognition models, as good accuracy in the estimation of aﬀective valence and
arousal was found by Zhang et al. [180]. These ﬁndings open interesting perspectives for the real-life
monitoring of emotional states.

Considering the aforementioned requirements, strain sensors recording the movements of the
chest wall appear to be particularly suitable solutions to monitor emotion-related changes in f R during
everyday life, with a preference for resistive, capacitive, and inductive sensors [24]. The metrological
characteristics of these sensors are detailed in a previous review by Massaroni et al. [24]. Strain sensors
can be embedded into straps, bands, and t-shirts, and the electronics can provide real-time analysis
and data streaming. Since the quality of the respiratory waveform aﬀects the possibility of obtaining
important respiratory features [192], it is preferable that the measurement systems used to detect the
ventilatory response to emotional stress are validated on a breath-by-breath basis. This requirement is

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

17 of 46

also needed for systems intended to provide ventilatory variability indices and respiratory biofeedback
support for emotion management (see also the “2.13. Respiratory biofeedback” section).

2.9. Cognitive Load

2.9.1. Current Evidence

It is well documented that f R, unlike VT, is sensitive to a variety of cognitive tasks and increases
in proportion to the diﬃculty of the task [9].
It is, therefore, evident that f R is the ventilatory
variable that preferentially reﬂects cognitive load [9]. At rest, tasks like mental arithmetic, inhibition
tasks, and working memory determine an increase in f R, with either no changes or a decrease in
VT [6,9,193–195]. Hence, f R monitoring may help the detection of cognitive load in a variety of
scenarios. This is particularly relevant for workers exposed to mentally demanding tasks and weighty
responsibilities, including surgeons, soldiers, and pilots [9,195]. The variability of breath-by-breath f R
may provide additional insight into how f R responds to cognitive load, but experimental evidence is
scant and further studies are required to elucidate this issue [9]. The fact that f R is sensitive to cognitive
load is preserved during exercise; a cognitive task superimposed to physical exercise increases f R
compared to the sole physical task condition [196,197]. This has important implications for monitoring
the extra load imposed by cognitive tasks during a variety of working and sporting activities that
are characterized by diﬀerent levels of psychophysical stress. The fact that f R substantially responds
to cognitive load suggests that f R may at least partially be regulated by the activity of brain areas
involved in cognitive processing. This input to ventilation has been deﬁned as the “wakefulness drive
to breathe”, i.e., an increase in central neural activity or arousal, similar to alertness or awareness [6].
While it has also been suggested that the increase in f R may reﬂect the metabolic demand of the
cognitive task [9], this interpretation is unlikely in light of the notion that metabolic inputs do not play
a substantial role in the regulation of f R [11,19–22]. Hence, f R is a sensitive marker of the cognitive
eﬀort exerted in a task, with important implications for the health and performance of a variety of
workers [198–200].

2.9.2. Measurement and Computing

The quantiﬁcation of cognitive load is of great relevance for numerous working activities.
Here, we present measurement techniques that can be used to continuously monitor f R during both
static and dynamic working activities. Typical examples of workers reporting cognitive load under
static activities are pilots, drivers, and computer workers [195,201,202]. As reported in a recent
review of vital sign monitoring in automotive environments, a variety of techniques can be used
for measuring f R [203]. Indeed the car can be equipped with diﬀerent sensors located in the seat,
the backrest, the safety belt, the steering wheel, or the cockpit [203]. Interesting solutions include the
use of strain/pressure sensors, camera-based sensors, and radar sensors [203]. Strain/pressure sensors
have been used more often than the other solutions [203], and relatively good performances were
reported in some studies [204]. Camera-based techniques are promising for obtaining accurate f R
values in this measurement scenario, but these solutions have received limited attention so far [203].
Several factors may explain the limited use of camera-based sensors in automotive environments [203],
including privacy issues (especially when the face of the user is captured), the computational processing
load of video images, and variable light conditions [203]. Another open challenge common to the
afore-mentioned techniques is the susceptibility to motion artifacts (e.g., vibrations of the car). As such,
Leonhardt et al. [203] suggest the simultaneous use of diﬀerent respiratory sensors and the development
of sensor fusion algorithms to provide a more robust measure of f R. Optical sensors, radiofrequency
sensors, and strain/pressure sensors embedded in instrumented chairs are also suitable for monitoring
computer workers [23,205–208]. Breath-by-breath f R estimated from video recordings is generally
more accurate compared to other contactless techniques, with errors below 4 breaths/min in the
10–40 breaths/min f R range [206].

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

18 of 46

Cognitive load is also common in a variety of workers performing dynamic tasks, including
soldiers [200] and healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses) [198]. Contact-based techniques are the
best candidates to monitor f R in these workers [24]. The sensors measuring chest wall movements
appear more suitable than others, especially strain sensors. These sensors register changes in strain
determined by respiration-related movements of the chest wall, and can be easily integrated into smart
garments in the case of resistive, capacitive, and inductive sensors [24]. The accuracy of strain sensors is
generally higher compared to that of contactless techniques (errors even lower than 1 breaths/min) [24].
Besides, the use of strain sensors is more suitable for breath-by-breath f R monitoring compared to
contactless techniques, as they require less computational resources compared to optical sensors,
where a high quantity of information is processed to extract the respiratory waveform. Furthermore,
strain sensors can be combined with other movement sensors (e.g., IMU) to reduce the inﬂuence of
motion artifacts and improve the robustness of breath-by-breath f R monitoring, even in real-time [24].
Breath-by-breath monitoring of f R is required when attempting to gain insight into cognitive load
by means of ventilatory variability analyses. Consequently, breath-by-breath validation is advised.
Conversely, when monitoring cognitive load by means of f R changes over time, average values over
60 s provide suﬃcient information.

2.10. Environment-Induced Stress

2.10.1. Current Evidence

Evidence shows that f R is very sensitive to diﬀerent environmental stressors, including heat, cold,
and hypoxia. Numerous studies suggest that f R is the primary component of minute ventilation that
responds to the heat stimulus [7,209]. A predominant increase in f R with heat is observed both at rest
and during exercise [7,209,210], where a good association between f R and body temperature is generally
found [210]. This association has important implications for the identiﬁcation of workers at risk of
heat strain [211,212], including those wearing protective garments (e.g., ﬁreﬁghters), those working
in tropical climates, soldiers, agricultural workers, and individuals participating in major events
organized in hot environments (e.g., sporting competitions). While the quantiﬁcation of environmental
factors (e.g., temperature and humidity) is useful to predict the risk of thermal strain, f R monitoring is
essential to understand the individual response to hot-environment exposure. Indeed, the attainment
of critical levels of body temperature may derive from the combined eﬀects of environmental-induced
stress, equipment used and physical activity (a major source of body temperature increase) [212–214].
f R is also sensitive to cold-induced stress, especially when sudden cold occurs. An emblematic and
dangerous condition is the response to cold water shock, where f R increases very rapidly and reaches
values even higher than 60 breaths/min [7,215]. Conversely, a preferential increase in VT is observed
under prolonged cold as a result of the metabolic demands of shivering [7,19]. On the other hand,
f R reﬂects a cold-induced reduction in exercise capacity, as it increases with cold water immersion [216]
and prolonged rain [217] compared to control conditions. These ﬁndings have implications for the
monitoring of workers operating in cold conditions, including soldiers and maritime workers [218].
f R is also sensitive to hypoxia both at rest and during exercise [7,219], with important implications for
individuals working in low oxygen environments [220,221]. Therefore, f R monitoring is fundamental
for workers exposed to a variety of environment-induced stressors, both in terms of health safety and
work productivity.

2.10.2. Measurement and Computing

The need to face environment-induced heat strain is a typical requirement for individuals
working in challenging environments. Here, we present the main measurement techniques suitable
for f R monitoring in hot environments. Some of the workers facing heat challenges wear masks as
personal protective equipment. Examples are self-contained breathing apparatus used by ﬁreﬁghters or
soldiers [222] and face masks used by healthcare professionals facing outbreak challenges (e.g., the 2013

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

19 of 46

Ebola virus West Africa outbreak) [214]. A variety of sensors can be integrated within a mask for
f R monitoring. These include airﬂow sensors (e.g., miniaturized pressure sensors and hot-wire
anemometers), temperature sensors (e.g., thermistors, thermocouples, and pyroelectric sensors),
humidity sensors, and acoustic sensors [24]. The performances of recently developed humidity sensors
deserve special consideration in this context. He et al. [223] reported that graphene nanochannels
conﬁned poly-dopamine humidity sensors embedded in a mask show high sensitivity, ultrafast
response (20 ms), and little humidity hysteresis. These performances were not substantially aﬀected by
high relative humidity (~75%), wind (up to 10 m/s) or physical activity [223]. Furthermore, the same
sensors may even be capable of voiceprint recognition [223], thus making it possible to recognize when
the respiratory signal is aﬀected by speech without the need for additional acoustic sensors. This is an
important feature for the continuous monitoring of f R in real-life working scenarios.

For those individuals not wearing protective masks, f R can be monitored with sensors embedded
in belts or garments. Diﬀerent commercial devices have been developed for vital sign monitoring
in occupational settings. These include ZephyrTM BioHarnessTM (Zephyr Technology Corporation,
Annapolis, MD, USA) (i.e., a belt embedding capacitive sensors) [224], EquivitalTM EQ02 LifeMonitor
(Hidalgo, Cambridge, UK) (i.e., a belt embedding inductive sensors) [225], LifeShirtTM (Vivometrics,
Ventura, CA, USA), and Hexoskin
(Carre´ Technologies Inc., Montreal, Canada) (i.e., shirts embedding
inductive sensors) [226,227]. These devices generally show good accuracy for f R measurement even
during exercise [14]. The performances of the ZephyrTM BioHarnessTM were also tested during
40 min of submaximal exercise in a hot environment and found to be relatively good (MOD ± LOAs,
0.2 ± 8.3 breaths/min), but not as good as those observed during exercise in temperate conditions
(MOD ± LOAs, −0.6 ± 5.0 breaths/min) [224]. This diﬀerence is possibly due to the fact that moisture
aﬀects the properties of the capacitive sensors [224]. Besides, the comfort of some of these devices could
be improved, and sensors directly integrated into smart textiles are attractive alternative solutions.

®

Several factors should be considered when developing smart clothing for hot environments
and extreme environments in general. Not only may diﬀerent sensors change their properties with
environmental factors (e.g., temperature and humidity), but conductive wires may also be aﬀected,
depending on the fabric of the smart textile [228]. When dealing with the choice of suitable sensors,
the use of ﬁber optic sensors is encouraged, as their performance is not aﬀected by changes in relative
humidity [229]. However, despite recent advances in the ﬁeld of respiratory monitoring with ﬁber
optic sensors [28,229], further research and development are needed to use this technology during
real-life working activities [28,229]. In an attempt to characterize the performances of smart textiles in
challenging environments, Torreblanca González et al. [228] have developed a methodology for testing
the eﬀect of environmental factors on speciﬁc components of a smart textile. This methodology or
similar approaches should be used to guarantee the correct functioning of smart garments designed
for f R monitoring in challenging environments.

In most of the cases, breath-by-breath f R monitoring is not necessarily required for the detection
of environment-induced stress, and data averaged over 60 s provide suﬃcient information. As such,
most of the commercial devices used in occupational settings have been validated over 60-s long time
windows [224,226,227]. More detailed information (e.g., 10-s average f R values) may be required for
speciﬁc needs, like for a proper description of the cold shock response [215].

2.11. Physical Eﬀort and Fatigue during Sport and Exercise

2.11.1. Current Evidence

As recently reviewed by Nicolò et al. [14], f R is one of the most important variables to be monitored
during sport and exercise. It is closely associated with perceived exertion during exercise protocols
with diﬀerent durations, formats (e.g., continuous and intermittent) and modalities (e.g., cycling and
running) [10,12,13,15,16,230], at least during high-intensity exercise [11]. Furthermore, it is associated
with exercise tolerance under a variety of experimental conditions, including hyperthermia, cold,

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

20 of 46

hypoxia, muscle damage, muscle fatigue, dietary-induced glycogen depletion, respiratory muscle
fatigue, and prior exercise [14,20,21]. Conversely, other physiological variables such as oxygen uptake,
blood lactate, and heart rate may not be associated with perceived exertion and exercise tolerance in at
least some of the aforementioned conditions [10,12–14,16,21]. Furthermore, unlike other physiological
variables, f R shows a rapid response at exercise onset and oﬀset [12,14,15,231], with important
implications for monitoring intermittent-based activities like soccer and other team sports [15]. As such,
f R provides invaluable insight into physical eﬀort, and its time course reﬂects exercise-induced fatigue
in diﬀerent populations [10,12–16,18,21].

The fact that f R is a valid marker of physical eﬀort is corroborated by our current understanding
of the control of ventilation [22]. During high-intensity exercise, the central motor drive relating
to voluntary muscle contraction (i.e., central command) is a major regulator of f R [11–13,17,21,22].
This is interesting considering that central command is also the primary regulator of perceived
exertion [22,232,233], thus explaining the close association between these two variables [11–14,22].
In fact, f R has several advantages over perceived exertion monitoring as it is an objective physiological
variable that can be monitored continuously and in real-time, and provides detailed information on
how physical eﬀort is distributed over a given training session or more [14,15]. When maximal eﬀort is
exerted, f R reaches peak values of about 50 breaths/min in the general population [234] and of about
60 breaths/min in athletes [12,13] ranging from 20-29 years old, but higher f R peak values can also
be observed [15,235]. The f R peak shows a 5% decrease per subsequent decade and slightly lower
values in females than males (the diﬀerence is 2 breaths/min on average), while it is not aﬀected by
stature [234]. However, inter-individual diﬀerences in f R values [14,15,235] imply that f R monitoring
should be tailored on an individual basis for training optimization and performance assessment.
This goal can be achieved with the routine use of accurate respiratory wearables speciﬁcally designed
for exercise monitoring.

2.11.2. Measurement and Computing

The importance of f R monitoring in sport and exercise is not currently followed up by widespread
use of respiratory devices in training and competition settings. This is partially due to the fact that f R has
only recently emerged as a fundamental variable to be monitored in the ﬁeld of sport [14]. Indeed, it has
even been deﬁned as “the neglected physiological measure” during exercise [14]. However, there is also
a paucity of wearable solutions speciﬁcally designed for exercise monitoring [14], which poses several
measurement challenges. Indeed, sport-speciﬁc movements, changes in body posture, and physical
contact with team members and opponents (e.g., in team sports) determine a variety of motion artifacts
that may impair the quality of the respiratory signal [236]. Furthermore, exercise presents some
thermoregulatory challenges (e.g., increases in body temperature and consequent sweating) that
need to be considered in the choice of sensors, textiles, and components of the measurement system.
Outdoor exercise monitoring is even more complex as environmental factors, including rain, snow,
wind, humidity, temperature, and noise may constitute further obstacles for using some measurement
techniques. This may be the case of the contactless methods [23], and of the contact-based methods
based on air temperature, air humidity and acoustic sensing [24]. On the other hand, the abundance
of technological solutions for measuring f R makes exercise monitoring entirely feasible if the sports
industry sector devotes eﬀorts in this direction.

We present here some suitable techniques to monitor f R in the challenging measurement
scenario of outdoor exercise. With the aforementioned considerations in mind, the contact-based
techniques measuring the movements of the chest wall appear to be good candidates [24].
As such, it is not surprising that most of the commercially available solutions tested during
exercise use these techniques [14], with a preference for strain-sensitive conductive sensors.
Among these, the most frequently used sensors are resistive, inductive, and capacitive sensors [14].
Diﬀerent commercial devices have been validated during exercise, and good performances were
generally reported [14,224,227]. However, in most of the cases, these devices were only validated

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

21 of 46

in the laboratory, and less is known on the feasibility and suitability of their routine use in applied
scenarios, like during outdoor training [237]. This is partially due to the fact that these devices were
not speciﬁcally designed for sporting activities and that their wearability needs to be improved in some
instances [14]. Besides, validation during exercise is rarely performed on a breath-by-breath basis,
even though this is an essential requirement for real-time respiratory monitoring [238]. Furthermore,
detailed information on f R (i.e., average values over 3–5 s) describes the rapid f R changes that
occur during intermittent-based activities and provides insight on how eﬀort is distributed during
exercise [14,15]. Therefore, breath-by-breath f R validation is strongly advised for sports respiratory
wearables [238].

Another critical factor when designing sports wearables is the choice of the sensor position.
Suitable body locations may partially change with exercise modality due to sport-speciﬁc postures and
movements, with clear diﬀerences observed when comparing cycling, running, rowing, and swimming.
Unfortunately, this problem has been overlooked, and only a few studies have attempted to address
this issue so far [42,154]. While the abdominal rib cage appears to be a good body site to locate
respiratory strain sensors during both running and cycling [42,154], sensors located on the abdomen
showed good performances in cycling [154] but not in running [42]. Diﬀerently, sensors located in the
upper thorax showed lower performances compared to those positioned on the abdominal rib cage
both in cycling and running [42,154]. Besides, the posterior side of the trunk (both at the abdominal
rib cage and abdomen levels) appears to be a suitable location that deserves consideration during
cycling exercise [154]. However, these are only preliminary ﬁndings that need to be corroborated and
expanded by future research.

Studies testing the performances of multi-sensor measuring systems are also valuable to shed some
light on the inﬂuence of the number of sensors on f R accuracy. Indeed, sensor redundancy is advised to
improve the robustness of f R measurement, and this is suggested by several studies performed both at
rest and during exercise [41,42,154]. Sensor fusion with other sensors (e.g., inertial sensors) may also be
beneﬁcial for motion artifact identiﬁcation and removal [42]. This requires the development of ad-hoc
and adaptable algorithms resilient to breathing-unrelated movements [41,42], which is an important
area of computing research for exercise monitoring. On the other hand, sensor redundancy may
determine an increase in battery consumption and, therefore, a trade-oﬀ needs to be found depending
on the speciﬁc application.

Some of the aforementioned challenges can be overcome with the advent of a new generation of
sensors and electronic components. Stretchable and ﬂexible sensors and electronics are particularly
suitable for exercise monitoring as they ensure good adhesion with the body while exerting a
minimal mechanical load on athletes [239]. Furthermore, the possibility to cover the stretchable
system with moisture-resistant barrier layers and coatings help limit failure in functionality caused
by sweat excretion and ﬂuid exposure [239]. Strain stretchable sensors can be designed in various
forms [240,241], which oﬀers a myriad of solutions to satisfy speciﬁc measurement needs. These systems
can be integrated into garments, patches, or can even be directly applied to the skin. For instance,
Yang et al. [242] developed and tested an epidermal electronic system composed of metallic sensors
connected by gold-on-polyethylene terephthalate serpentine ribbons, and promising results were
observed for f R measurement. The development of these wearable devices has been favored by
advances in microelectronics and the use of intrinsically stretchable and ﬂexible materials [239].
Other interesting solutions proposed for f R measurement are textile-based sensors, conductive yarns,
and highly-sensitive graphene strain sensors [240,243,244]. Facing the measurement challenges posed
by sport and exercise has several advantages that go beyond this ﬁeld of use and the sports industry
sector. Indeed, accurate respiratory wearables suited for exercise monitoring can easily be scalable for
everyday-life monitoring of patients, workers, and other users.

2.12. Respiratory Artifacts

2.12.1. Current Evidence

A highly relevant ﬁeld of research is the identiﬁcation and compensation of respiratory artifacts
to improve other biological measurements. The alternation of inspiration and expiration determines
periodic movements of the organs situated in the abdominal and thoracic cavities, hence impairing
the recording of biological signals coming from these body sites. Most of the imaging techniques
used for medical diagnosis suﬀer from this problem, with speciﬁc challenges for diﬀerent techniques.
For instance, the time required to image the thorax is diﬀerent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
(6–9 min) and Computed Tomography (CT) (~15 s) [245], which increases the diﬃculty of combining
images acquired with the two diﬀerent techniques [245]. Hence, it is not uncommon to observe
between-image spatial misalignments, which may result in the mislocalization of a tumor lesion or
the inaccurate quantiﬁcation of indicators used as criteria for malignancy [245]. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) quality is also impaired by respiratory artifacts [246]. As such, research in the area of
respiratory artifact compensation is growing exponentially, and a variety of technological solutions
are currently available for the improvement of imaging for medical diagnosis [247,248]. Likewise,
the management of respiratory artifacts is essential for some therapeutic ﬁelds, and especially for
radiotherapy [249]. Indeed, the side eﬀects of radiotherapy are reduced if the patient’s breathing
pattern is taken into account, and a consequent improvement in therapy eﬀectiveness can also be
observed. An example is the use of the deep inspiration breath-hold technique in breast cancer
patients, which reduces the radiation dose to healthy organs at risk, including the heart [249]. The deep
inspiration moves the heart away from the radiotherapy beam, and the breath-hold maneuver
minimizes respiratory movements. This and other breathing techniques used for radiotherapy
(e.g., respiratory gating) are performed with the help of respiratory biofeedback [250], thus making
respiratory monitoring essential. Other biological signals are also aﬀected by respiratory artifacts,
including the ECG and the electroencephalographic signals, and diﬀerent approaches have been
proposed to address this issue [126,251–253]. Hence, respiratory monitoring is fundamental for
improving the quality of a variety of biological signals and the management of diﬀerent diseases.

2.12.2. Measurement and Computing

The accurate and robust measurement of the respiratory waveform (not only of f R) is fundamental
to counteract the challenges posed by respiratory artifacts. Here, we present some suitable techniques
to record the respiratory waveform during imaging acquisition for diagnostic purposes, and during
radiotherapy delivery. A variety of contact-based and contactless techniques can be used to improve
diagnostic imaging, but the materials composing the measurement systems need to be compatible
with magnetic ﬁelds. Another requirement is the connection between the measurement system
and the controller of imaging device scans (e.g., CT, PET, and MRI). The simultaneous recording of
diagnostic images and of the respiratory waveform allows for respiratory artifact removal through
motion compensation algorithms [245]. In most of the cases, the respiratory waveform is obtained
with sensors capable of measuring respiratory-induced phenomena. Some examples are pressure
sensors, airﬂow sensors, temperature sensors, and the Real-Time Position Management Respiratory
Gating System (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) [245]. Other approaches are based on
recording the respiratory waveform directly from CT or MRI scans, without the need for additional
respiratory sensors. For instance, Shahzadi et al. [246] tested the eﬃcacy of three diﬀerent methods
of respiratory motion detection and compensation using data directly acquired from MRI under
free-breathing conditions. The methods were based on the Golden-Angle Radial Sparse Parallel MRI
technique that combines parallel imaging and golden-angle radial sampling. These methods showed
good performance and the possibility to sort the data into diﬀerent respiratory phases, with their
suitability depending upon the speciﬁc clinical application [246]. The presence of respiratory artifacts
is particularly challenging in combined PET/CT imaging because of the diﬀerent acquisition time of

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

23 of 46

PET and CT and of possible misalignments between images. Given the abundance of methods for
correcting motion in CT and PET images, the interested reader is referred to a previous review [245]
for detailed information on this topic. With the technological advances of imaging in resolution and
quality, an ever-increasing demand for respiratory artifact compensation solutions is expected in the
next future [247].

Numerous techniques and algorithms used to improve diagnostic images’ quality are also suitable
for respiratory artifact management during radiotherapy delivery. In this measurement scenario, it is
even more important that the respiratory waveform is recorded in real time, and the use of respiratory
biofeedback is common [250]. Diﬀerent technologies based on direct contact with the body are available
for this purpose. Among others, commercial devices based on airﬂow measurement are used in clinical
practice to help patients perform apnea maneuvers during radiotherapy. An example is the Active
Breathing Coordinator developed by Elekta (Elekta Oncology systems Ltd, Crawley, West Sussex,
UK), an apparatus consisting of a turbine ﬂow meter and a balloon valve capable of enforcing patient
breath-holds at preselected respiratory volumes [254]. While methods based on airﬂow measurement
are accurate, they are also obtrusive and sometimes not tolerated by patients.

In some radiotherapy procedures, the recording of the chest wall position is of additional value to
address the problem of inaccurate radiation dose delivery caused by respiratory movements. Some of
the technologies used to track respiration-induced chest wall movements during radiotherapy have been
reviewed by Glide-Hurst and Chetty [255]. Among these, pressure-sensitive belts, infrared tracking
systems, and camera-based sensors are commonly employed in clinical practice [255]. An example of a
pressure-sensitive belt solution is the Anzai Respiratory Gating System (Anzai Medical Co. Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan) [256]; the sensitive element is located at the right upper quadrant of a patient’s abdomen and
the system includes two pressure sensors (with diﬀerent sensitivities for patients with shallow vs. deep
respiration amplitudes) [256]. The CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is an example of an
infrared tracking system used to record the trajectories of hemispherical photo-reﬂective markers taped
on the skin of the patient undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery [257]. Respiratory gating techniques
have also been implemented with the use of an infrared respiratory camera tracking the movements
of a reﬂective marker box placed on the patient’s abdominal surface [258]. Another alternative
technique for respiratory motion compensation during radiotherapy is based on ultrasound motion
tracking [259,260]. The ultrasound system used by Ting et al. [259,260] records respiratory movements
at 30 Hz, with a total delay time of approximately 350 ms. Together with the use of respiratory motion
algorithms, these performances may favor a reduction in the size of the planning target volume margin
and an increase in the accuracy of the radiotherapy dose delivery [260].

The use of markers for tracking chest wall movements may suﬀer from the disadvantage of
relative motion between the skin and the tracking markers [261]. This problem can be overcome
with the use of video markerless approaches. Numerous optical systems that do not require markers
are commercially available, including the AlignRT/GateCT (VisionRT Ltd, London, UK), the Sentinel
(C-RAD AB, Uppsala, Sweden), and the Galaxy systems (LAP Laser, Luneburg, Germany) [261].
The AlignRT optical system was used by Schaerer et al. [261] to record the chest wall movements at
three diﬀerent phases of the breathing cycle (i.e., maximum inhale, maximum exhale, and an arbitrarily
chosen intermediate position) and to develop an algorithm suitable for respiratory artifact removal.
Depth sensors can also be used for respiratory motion tracking during radiotherapy. A good agreement
was found between the Microsoft Kinect v2 and the more commonly used Anzai Respiratory Gating
System and Varian’s RPM system [262]. The characteristics and ease of use of depth sensors [262]
provide interesting avenues for improving radiotherapy management.

2.13. Respiratory Biofeedback

2.13.1. Current Evidence

The voluntary modulation of breathing leads to a series of systemic eﬀects inducing potential
beneﬁts in a range of disorders. For instance, slow breathing decreases blood pressure in patients with
hypertension [263], reduces stress, anxiety, and pain [264–270], reduces the frequency and severity
of migraine headaches [271], and improves various aspects of health-related quality of life in heart
failure patients [272,273]. These eﬀects are best achieved if the voluntary modulation of breathing
is performed via respiratory biofeedback, which facilitates the maintenance of a given breathing
pace or the execution of speciﬁc breathing exercises. f R is a fundamental variable for any respiratory
biofeedback strategy, but other ventilatory variables may also prove useful, such as VT, inspiratory
time, and expiratory time [274,275]. The primary role of f R in respiratory biofeedback is given by
the marked eﬀect of its change on diﬀerent physiological systems, including the modulation of heart
rate variability, which is particularly eﬀective at f R values around 6 breaths/min [276]. It has even
been suggested that the eﬀect of respiratory modulation on heart rate variability is maximized when
f R is set at the so-called individual resonant frequency, but more research is needed to further test
this hypothesis [276]. Respiratory biofeedback is usually delivered by sound output and/or visual
feedback, including attractive forms like music and biofeedback games [275,277,278]. It is a very useful
technique to learn respiratory skills and exercises (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing) [271], especially
for less compliant individuals like children and older adults. For instance, respiratory biofeedback
is eﬀectively used in tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy, where it favors therapy delivery
while minimizing the therapy side eﬀects [250]. Therefore, respiratory biofeedback has important
implications in various settings, including clinical, rehabilitation, occupational, and leisure settings.
Finally, research on respiratory biofeedback is very promising as it may help reconsider the role of
respiratory devices, which may oﬀer therapeutic solutions along with respiratory monitoring.

2.13.2. Measurement and Computing

The essential requirement for any respiratory biofeedback system is the real-time display of the
respiratory signal, either in the form of raw data (respiratory waveform) or in the form of ventilatory
variables (e.g., f R, VT, inspiratory time, and expiratory time). In most cases, the patient is required to
match a predeﬁned respiratory pattern template by altering breathing voluntarily. Visual, auditory,
or other forms of feedback are provided to help the patient accomplish this task. The choice of the
respiratory measurement technique depends on the speciﬁc goal to achieve and on related measurement
requirements. Here we provide an example of two measurement scenarios, where the patient performs
(1) breathing exercises as part of structured therapeutic plans; or (2) biofeedback-guided exercises for
everyday-life stress management.

Respiratory biofeedback is particularly relevant for patients performing breathing exercises as
part of their therapeutic plans. This is the case for patients undergoing radiotherapy, who need
to perform breathing familiarization sessions before real therapy sessions. Commercially available
depth cameras (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) are good and relatively low-cost solutions to help patients
practice with breathing exercises and procedures. When assessing the reproducibility of breathing
maneuvers used for image-guided interventions, Heerink et al. [279] found that respiratory biofeedback
delivered with the Microsoft Kinect v1 camera (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) was eﬀective in
reducing the respiratory motion variability observed when no biofeedback was used, with important
implications for radiotherapy delivery. The patient undergoing radiotherapy is also advised to
perform biofeedback-guided respiratory training outside of the clinical setting, although this practice
is not performed regularly. In an attempt to partly overcome this limitation, Oh et al. [280] have
developed a respiratory biofeedback system based on a micro-electro-mechanical-system magnetic
sensor. This system showed good performances and relatively small errors in respiratory frequency
and amplitude quantiﬁcation [280]. However, the high magnetic ﬁelds generated by this system limit

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

25 of 46

its applicability in some populations, including patients with pacemakers [280]. The use of other
sensors registering respiration-induced chest wall movements (e.g., strain sensors) [24] can overcome
this problem.

Other patients that would beneﬁt from respiratory biofeedback therapies are those with
hypertension [263,273,281–283] or panic disorders [284,285]. Substantial evidence shows a signiﬁcant
reduction in blood pressure with the administration of biofeedback-guided slow deep breathing
exercises [273,281,282]. A number of these studies have used an FDA-approved commercially
®
available biofeedback system called RESPeRATE
(Intercure Inc, Fort Lee, NJ, USA) [273,281–283],
which interactively reduces the patient’s f R through auditory feedback with diﬀerent tones for the
inhalation and exhalation phases. This system is suitable for self-treatment at home and is made up of
a sensor registering chest-wall movements embedded in an elastic belt, a computerized display, and
headphones [282]. Diﬀerently, patients with panic disorders are usually treated with capnometry guided
respiratory biofeedback because these patients hyperventilate and need to restore isocapnia [284,285].
Capnometry guided respiratory biofeedback provides values of end-tidal carbon dioxide and f R to
the user. Tolin et al. [285] have documented the feasibility of a remote monitoring service based on
home-delivered capnometry-guided biofeedback therapy. The measuring system consisted of a CO2
sensor, a nasal cannula, and an app installed on a smart device that provided real-time audiovisual
feedback of the variables of interest. Data from each session were streamed on a secure service after
each treatment, thus allowing the clinician to remotely evaluate clinical progress and therapeutic
adherence [285].

Respiratory biofeedback is also gaining interest in stress management during everyday life [275].
For instance, technological solutions may help face acute events of stress, anxiety, or panic. This need
requires the use of unobtrusive technologies, with smart garments being particularly suitable as the user
can access respiratory biofeedback as needed. Several sensors may be integrated into shirts or bands,
including inductive, resistive, capacitive, and impedance sensors [24]. Among these, sensors with good
response time and an output proportional to airﬂow should be preferred, as respiratory biofeedback
delivery is more eﬀective when respiratory amplitude (surrogate measure of VT) values are provided
together with f R values. Most of the solutions proposed so far have used sensors embedded in
belts [278,286,287], but smart clothing may oﬀer additional beneﬁts in terms of wearability [288].

3. A Conceptual Framework for the Development of Respiratory Monitoring Services

The previous section has highlighted the importance of respiratory monitoring for diﬀerent
goals and measurement scenarios, thus pointing to the need to approach respiratory monitoring from
a multidisciplinary perspective. Indeed, current advances in the ﬁelds of respiratory physiology,
applied sciences, and technological development have so far not been accompanied by a proportional
increase in the development and diﬀusion of respiratory monitoring services. Here we show how
fruitful synergies between diﬀerent disciplines may provide avenues to address this issue (see Figure 2
for a schematic representation).

Research in the ﬁeld of respiratory physiology provides important insight into the rationale behind
the choice of the ventilatory variables to monitor in diﬀerent ﬁelds and applications. Indeed, the fact
that f R is more sensitive than tidal volume to a variety of stressors (see Section 2 for details) is in line
with our current understanding of the control of ventilation. Increasing evidence suggests that f R is
substantially regulated by non-metabolic inputs [7,11,12,17,19–22], including brain areas relating to
motor control, and those involved in emotion and cognitive processing [6,8,11,12,22]. This explains
why f R often increases in proportion to the extent of emotional stress, cognitive load, dyspnea,
heat stimuli, and physical eﬀort [7–9,12,13,18,22,210]. As such, f R is the behavioral component of
minute ventilation [19,20,22]. Conversely, most of these factors/conditions do not determine a consistent
change in VT, which may even show opposite responses compared to those of f R, as observed under
the inﬂuence of emotional and cognitive stimuli [6,8,193]. Indeed, VT is the metabolic component of
minute ventilation, and is adjusted on the basis of metabolic inputs and f R levels to match alveolar

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

ventilation with metabolic requirements [11,20,22]. In turn, f R is inﬂuenced by VT, but to a minor
extent compared to how VT is aﬀected by f R [11,22]. These are the essential features (see Figure 3)
of a recently-developed model of ventilatory control [11,12,19,22], which provides a physiological
rationale for choosing when to monitor VT alongside f R. The model shows that the measure of VT is
essential when respiratory monitoring is performed to identify the human response to metabolic stimuli
like hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis. While this model deliberately simpliﬁes the complexity of
breathing control [7,19,20,22], it oﬀers valuable insight on how to choose the ventilatory variables
needed in diﬀerent monitoring services.

Figure 2. Schematic representation of the interactions between respiratory physiology, applied sciences,
and technological development. The Figure shows how fruitful synergies between diﬀerent disciplines
are essential for the development of respiratory monitoring services.

Figure 3. Schematic representation of a simple model of ventilatory control (see Nicolò and Sacchetti [22]
for further information). While respiratory rate (the behavioral component of minute ventilation) is
substantially inﬂuenced by non-metabolic stressors, VT (the metabolic component of minute ventilation)
satisﬁes the metabolic requirements of the human body. As such VT is ﬁne-tuned according to the
levels of respiratory rate and the magnitude of metabolic inputs, while f R is inﬂuenced by VT to a lesser
extent. This model explains why f R is more sensitive than VT to a variety of non-metabolic stressors
and corroborates the importance of f R monitoring in diﬀerent ﬁelds of use.

Sensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 45  Respiratory biofeedback is also gaining interest in stress management during everyday life [275]. For instance, technological solutions may help face acute events of stress, anxiety, or panic.

A Conceptual Framework for the Development of Respiratory Monitoring Services The previous section has highlighted the importance of respiratory monitoring for different goals and measurement scenarios, thus pointing to the need to approach respiratory monitoring from a multidisciplinary perspective. Indeed, current advances in the fields of respiratory physiology, applied sciences, and technological development have so far not been accompanied by a proportional increase in the development and diffusion of respiratory monitoring services. Here we show how fruitful synergies between different disciplines may provide avenues to address this issue (see Figure 2 for a schematic representation).  Figure 2. Schematic representation of the interactions between respiratory physiology, applied sciences, and technological development. The Figure shows how fruitful synergies between different disciplines are essential for the development of respiratory monitoring services. Research in the field of respiratory physiology provides important insight into the rationale behind the choice of the ventilatory variables to monitor in different fields and applications.

As such, fR is the behavioral component of minute ventilation [19,20,22]. Conversely, most of these factors/conditions do not Sensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW 26 of 45  determine a consistent change in VT, which may even show opposite responses compared to those of fR, as observed under the influence of emotional and cognitive stimuli [6,8,193]. Indeed, VT is the metabolic component of minute ventilation, and is adjusted on the basis of metabolic inputs and fR levels to match alveolar ventilation with metabolic requirements [11,20,22]. In turn, fR is influenced by VT, but to a minor extent compared to how VT is affected by fR [11,22]. These are the essential features (see Figure 3) of a recently-developed model of ventilatory control [11,12,19,22], which provides a physiological rationale for choosing when to monitor VT alongside fR. The model shows that the measure of VT is essential when respiratory monitoring is performed to identify the human response to metabolic stimuli like hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis. While this model deliberately simplifies the complexity of breathing control [7,19,20,22], it offers valuable insight on how to choose the ventilatory variables needed in different monitoring services.  Figure 3. Schematic representation of a simple model of ventilatory control (see Nicolò and Sacchetti [22] for further information). While respiratory rate (the behavioral component of minute ventilation) is substantially influenced by non-metabolic stressors, VT (the metabolic component of minute ventilation) satisfies the metabolic requirements of the human body. As such VT is fine-tuned according to the levels of respiratory rate and the magnitude of metabolic inputs, while fR is influenced by VT to a lesser extent. This model explains why fR is more sensitive than VT to a variety of non-metabolic stressors and corroborates the importance of fR monitoring in different fields of use. Advances in the field of respiratory physiology are, in turn, favored by technological development and experimental evidence provided by applied sciences. For instance, the vast amount of evidence supporting the clinical relevance of fR for a variety of diseases should guide basic research in the attempt to unravel the mechanisms underlying the commonly observed tachypneic breathing pattern. For instance, the well-documented importance of fR in the context of cardiac arrest and severe pneumonia should trigger further research aiming to understand why fR is particularly sensitive to these diseases. The importance of technological development for respiratory physiology and applied sciences is straightforward, as the widespread availability of accurate respiratory devices may speed up basic and applied research in different fields. This, in turn, would produce further knowledge to guide the development of respiratory measurement systems and monitoring services. Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

Advances in the ﬁeld of respiratory physiology are, in turn, favored by technological development
and experimental evidence provided by applied sciences. For instance, the vast amount of evidence
supporting the clinical relevance of f R for a variety of diseases should guide basic research in the
attempt to unravel the mechanisms underlying the commonly observed tachypneic breathing pattern.
For instance, the well-documented importance of f R in the context of cardiac arrest and severe
pneumonia should trigger further research aiming to understand why f R is particularly sensitive to
these diseases. The importance of technological development for respiratory physiology and applied
sciences is straightforward, as the widespread availability of accurate respiratory devices may speed
up basic and applied research in diﬀerent ﬁelds. This, in turn, would produce further knowledge to
guide the development of respiratory measurement systems and monitoring services.

The need for a multidisciplinary approach to respiratory monitoring is also manifested by the
diﬀerent levels of expertise required to structure respiratory monitoring services. As shown in
Section 2, the development of new technologies should be guided by speciﬁc monitoring needs because
measurement requirements depend on monitoring goals and measurement scenarios. Yet, respiratory
devices are often not developed for speciﬁc purposes. An example is the limited diﬀusion of respiratory
wearables speciﬁcally designed for monitoring sporting activities [14], where diﬀerent measuring
challenges arise. Likewise, limitations are encountered in the development of respiratory devices to
support the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in low-resource settings, where speciﬁc requirements
are needed [89]. To partially address these challenges, we have developed a conceptual framework
that may help to guide the development of respiratory monitoring services (see Figure 4).

The deﬁnition of monitoring goals is the ﬁrst step in the development of a respiratory monitoring
service. This is fundamental because the technological solutions identiﬁed may change extensively if
the monitoring goal is, for instance, to detect apnea, identify emotional stress, or measure physical eﬀort
during exercise. It is also important to deﬁne the speciﬁc measurement scenario, which should orient the
choice of measurement techniques. An example is provided in Figure 4 (panel B), which reports diﬀerent
measurement techniques for the remote respiratory monitoring of COVID-19 patients, depending on
the need for periodic vital sign monitoring, or continuous monitoring [5]. Several other examples
are provided in Section 2. When the monitoring goal and scenario are established, the development
of a conceptual framework of the monitoring service will help identify relevant characteristics of
the service, including users, resources, and facilities. An example is the framework proposed by
Naranjo-Hernández et al. [157] (Figure 4, panel C), where a smart garment and a communication
platform enable the remote monitoring of COPD patients by healthcare professionals and caregivers in
diﬀerent scenarios (i.e., hospital, e-health center, home and outdoor monitoring).

The next step is the identiﬁcation of relevant variables, sensors and algorithms. The above
considerations on when to monitor VT provide an example of how to choose relevant ventilatory
variables. Similar considerations may lead to the identiﬁcation of other physiological and mechanical
variables in order to achieve the desired goals. The diﬀerent variables selected may be computed
from diﬀerent signals (e.g., respiratory waveform, ECG, and accelerometer signal), each requiring
the use of speciﬁc sensors and algorithms. The diﬀerent signal outputs can be combined to obtain
monitoring features and metrics. An example is the detection of apnea/hypopnea events, which is often
performed with the simultaneous recording of signals coming from diﬀerent sensors (see Figure 4,
panel D). For each signal selected, the elements composing the measurement chain need to be identiﬁed,
i.e., measurand, sensor, electronics, and data acquisition, and signal analysis stages. As detailed by
Massaroni et al. [24], the elements of the measurement chain change according to the diﬀerent sensors
used, and an example is provided in Figure 4 (panel E) for resistive sensors used to measure f R.

The output of all the signals should be compared with similar signals coming from reference
systems, and each variable of interest should be validated. The validation output is aﬀected by
diﬀerent factors, including the choice of the reference system, the algorithms used for signal processing,
the validation indices selected, and the validation protocol and scenario. While it is outside of the scope
of the present manuscript to discuss these points, the interested reader is referred to previous studies

Sensors 2020, 20, 6396

providing more details on this issue [26,62,65,89]. As an example, commonly computed validation
indices are Mean of Diﬀerence and Limits of Agreement, which provide information on both the
accuracy and precision of the tested measurement system. These indices are often depicted graphically
by means of the Bland-Altman plot [289], as shown in the example provided in Figure 4 (panel F) [290].
Based on the characteristics of the measurement system and the respiratory service, a suitable
communication architecture needs to be identiﬁed to enable the service. Three diﬀerent layers
(or tiers) can usually be identiﬁed in a communication architecture [291,292]. The ﬁrst layer pertains
to the communication between the body sensors and the sink, and is therefore called sensor-based
tier [291,292]. The second layer is called gateway-based tier and pertains to the communication between
the sink and one or multiple access points (e.g., smart device) [291,292]. The third layer pertains
the communication beyond the access points and is usually composed of a medical server, a patient
database, and a medical environment (in healthcare monitoring systems) [291,292]. Figure 4 (panel G)
shows an example of a communication architecture used for the remote monitoring of COPD patients,
where data from wearable sensors are acquired by a smart device through wireless communication and
are streamed to health professionals and caregivers through cloud and telecom infrastructures [293].
Prior to service implementation in real contexts, a performance assessment of the service needs to
be performed. Some of the factors that can be evaluated at this level are data transmission performance,
data security, and user-friendliness [294–296]. Among diﬀerent options, data transmission performance
can be assessed with metrics like % data received and time delay [295], as reported in the example
provided in Figure 4 (panel H). Once the service is implemented in routine activities, the eﬃcacy of
the service needs to be evaluated. The assessment methodology may depend on the speciﬁc service
developed. A recent study [296] has reported an interesting methodological approach to evaluate
the eﬃcacy of smartphone-based respiratory monitoring services. The authors have identiﬁed four
categories determining the eﬃcacy of respiratory services, i.e., smartphone performance metrics
factors (e.g., data security and privacy level), patient status factors (e.g., level of patient satisfaction),
cost-related factors (e.g., cost to the customers), and resource-related factors (e.g., internet connectivity
level) [296]. For the healthcare services based on the use of early warning scores to predict clinical
outcomes, the eﬃcacy is commonly evaluated by computing metrics of speciﬁcity and sensitivity, and by
producing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [110]. An example is provided in Figure 4
(panel I), which reports ROC curves for repeated respiratory rate measurements collected within
the ﬁrst hours from admission to an emergency department [116]. In this example, the ROC curves
show that repeated measurements of respiratory rate are better associated with patient deterioration
compared to a single measurement at hospital admission [116]. However, recent systematic reviews
have found little evidence of any clinical eﬀectiveness of the early warning scores commonly used in
the clinical setting [110,297,298]. This ﬁnding can be largely attributed to a series of methodological
weaknesses related to the development and validation of early warning scores, including participant
selection, the choice of outcome measures, and the analysis performed (Figure 4, panel J) [110].
To overcome this problem, Gerry et al. [110] have provided a series of recommendations on population
description, sample size, missing data management, outcome measures, time horizons, statistical
methods, validation methodology, and on the selection of metrics for testing model performance [110].
This is an emblematic example of how evidence-based approaches should guide the improvement of
respiratory monitoring services. Given the ever-increasing growth of science and technology in the
ﬁeld of respiratory monitoring, an evidence-based approach should also be used to improve respiratory
monitoring services at any step of the here proposed framework.

4. Perspectives and Challenges of Respiratory Rate Monitoring

Despite the importance of f R in diﬀerent ﬁelds of use, the fact that f R is sensitive to a variety of
non-metabolic stressors [7–9,11,12,19–21] may impair our understanding of the factors determining
an increase in f R. As shown in Figure 5, similar values of f R can be observed when the user is
under cognitive load, emotional stress, pain, dyspnea, or is simply performing moderate exercise.
This problem can be partly overcome with the simultaneous measurement of other physiological and
mechanical variables. For instance, it is important to characterize the postures and activities of the
user, as commonly performed with the use of inertial sensors [299]. This is particularly relevant for
monitoring dyspnea and physical eﬀort during everyday life activities and exercise [27], but is also
important for the identiﬁcation of suitable portions of the respiratory signal (e.g., with no movements or
artifacts) to compute resting f R [133]. The concomitant measure of other vital signs is also beneﬁcial, as in
the development of early warning scores for the prediction of clinical deterioration [4]. Besides, f R and
its variability change across wakefulness and diﬀerent sleep stages [300,301], which is relevant when
interpreting nocturnal f R values. Sleep stages are usually identiﬁed with electroencephalography,
but approaches based on breathing sound processing have also been proposed [81]. Another strategy

to gain insight into the factors behind the changes in f R is the recording of concomitant symptoms,
including pain, dyspnea, and emotional stress. These symptoms can be assessed with validated
scales [302,303], but this approach can only be used on collaborative patients.

Computing solutions may also provide insight into the factors aﬀecting f R. For instance, analyses
of ventilatory variability have been used to identify cognitive load and emotional stress [9,191],
but further research is needed to guide their implementation in respiratory monitoring services.
Artiﬁcial intelligence approaches can also be applied to respiratory monitoring for the identiﬁcation of
the diﬀerent stressors reported in Figure 5. Some of these methods of analysis have been used in the
ﬁeld of apnea monitoring [87], for the prediction of clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients [304],
and for the identiﬁcation of opioid-induced ataxic breathing [173]. Another common issue in the ﬁeld of
healthcare is the use of ﬁxed (sometimes arbitrary) cut-oﬀ values of f R [100,119], which do not take into
account inter-individual diﬀerences in f R resting values and in the responses to diﬀerent stressors [3,305].
Most of these challenges can be overcome with the development of accurate respiratory systems and
the eﬀective implementation of respiratory monitoring services in routine use. This would lead to
the availability of a large amount of respiratory data obtained in diﬀerent measurement scenarios,
hence fostering the processes described in Figures 2 and 4.

This review presents a multidisciplinary approach to respiratory rate monitoring, with the aim
to improve the development of respiratory monitoring services in diﬀerent ﬁelds of use. We have
identiﬁed thirteen monitoring goals where the measure of respiratory rate is invaluable and presented

goals presented has allowed us to show diﬀerences in the state of development of respiratory services
across diﬀerent ﬁelds of use. For instance, the ﬁeld of apnea detection is regulated by detailed guidelines
on the use of respiratory sensors, while the ﬁeld of pneumonia suﬀers from a lack of consensus on how
to accurately and objectively measure f R. Likewise, respiratory monitoring requires more consideration
and development in the ﬁeld of sport and exercise, where f R is emerging as a valid marker of physical
eﬀort and exercise-induced fatigue. We hope that the multidisciplinary approach presented may have
contributed to corroborate the importance of measuring f R in diﬀerent ﬁelds, and to provide solutions
for the eﬀective development of respiratory monitoring services.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for remote patient monitoring. At
the time of writing this article, the majority of countries worldwide are on lockdown to minimize
the spread of the virus, and most of the patients who tested (or are suspected to be) positive for
COVID-19 are in self-isolation at home. Even robust healthcare systems are facing a shortage
of healthcare professionals, personal protective equipment, beds, and mechanical ventilators in
intensive-care-units (ICU) (Kissler et al., 2020), thus highlighting the need for alternative medical
solutions, including remote patient monitoring (Alwashmi, 2020; FDA, 2020; Ohannessian et al.,
2020). New policies have therefore been introduced to promote the development of monitoring
devices (FDA, 2020), thus creating favorable opportunities to improve the remote monitoring of
some overlooked vital signs. This is especially the case for respiratory rate (RR), which is currently
poorly recorded despite its relevance in the context of COVID-19.

Current COVID-19 guidelines suggest measuring resting RR to inform triage decisions,
diagnosis, prognosis, and as a criterion for ICU admission and for the early recognition of
COVID-19 patient deterioration. The World Health Organization indicates that a resting value
of RR > 30 breaths/min is a critical sign for the diagnosis of severe pneumonia in adults,
while the cut-oﬀ value for children varies according to age (World Health Organization, 2020).
At triage, RR values are used to support the assignment of patients to diﬀerent categories and
to make decisions on the use of supplemental oxygen (Ayebare et al., 2020; Italian Thoracic
Society Italian Respiratory Society, 2020). The treatment of patients aﬀected by acute respiratory
insuﬃciency from COVID-19 is also tailored considering RR values (Italian Thoracic Society
Italian Respiratory Society, 2020). Furthermore, RR helps with the timely recognition of COVID-19
patient deterioration, thus contributing to the implementation of early intervention strategies (Sun
et al., 2020). Resting RR values also contribute to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients as ICU
admission and mortality are associated with signiﬁcantly higher RR values compared to non-ICU
patients and survivors (Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Besides, the normalization of resting
RR is among the signs used to quantify the time to clinical recovery from COVID-19 infection
(Al-Tawﬁq et al., 2020).

The clinical relevance of RR mandates the improvement of the accuracy of RR measurements
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RR measurements too often rely on manual counting in
the clinical setting and are often poorly performed out of the hospital. For instance, guidelines
for telephone consultation of COVID-19 patients recognize the fundamental role of RR in the
assessment of patients, but propose unsatisfying solutions for its remote assessment (Greenhalgh
et al., 2020). Since patients usually have no direct access to respiratory devices, RR is self-reported
by answering the question “Is your breathing faster, slower, or the same as normal?” (Greenhalgh
et al., 2020). However, experimental data discourage the self-report of RR and highlight how
measurement awareness aﬀects resting RR values (Hill et al., 2018). On the other hand, several
sensors and techniques can be used for the accurate remote monitoring of RR; some of these

are ready-to-use in the face of the COVID-19 challenge, while
others deserve further consideration in the future.

TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FOR
REMOTE RESPIRATORY RATE
MONITORING

The abundance of techniques currently available can satisfy the
various needs of COVID-19 patients with diﬀerent severities
of symptoms (see Figure 1). We can diﬀerentiate techniques
for patients
that need (1) periodic short-term screening
or (2) continuous monitoring. The majority of COVID-19
patients have mild symptoms and can be screened periodically
(e.g., twice a day) for vital signs. These patients can take
advantage of emerging technologies exploiting built-in cameras
of smartphones, tablets, and laptops to record RR from the
respiratory-induced chest wall movements or superﬁcial changes
in face perfusion (Poh et al., 2011; Brüser et al., 2015). By
registering a short video capturing the torso area or the face
of the seated patient, RR (and other vital signs like heart rate)
can be streamed to healthcare professionals using an internet
connection (Brüser et al., 2015). This technique is discreet,
available in the market, and shows medical-grade accuracy (error
<1 breaths/min) when the patient is stationary (Massaroni et al.,
2019a). The wide spread use of smart devices makes camera-
based solutions immediately available, relatively low-cost, and
user friendly. Furthermore, the availability of smart devices is
becoming fundamental in the time of COVID-19, and healthcare
systems can beneﬁt from it.

For patients needing continuous monitoring (e.g., older
adults, patients with comorbidities or more severe symptoms),

smart devices oﬀer another

prolonged acquisition through camera-based methods is not
recommended given the higher amount of data to be processed.
In these cases,
ready-to-use
technological solution, i.e., the recording of breathing sounds
using built-in microphones (Brüser et al., 2015; Nam et al.,
2015). Currently available systems have implemented this
technology for continuous RR monitoring and unobtrusive
sleep apnea detection in quiet environments, with good results
in terms of accuracy (error <1%) (Nam et al., 2015). Other
solutions available in the market monitor RR continuously
with strain or pressure sensors installed underneath mattresses,
under bedposts, and on the seating area and backrest of
chairs (Watanabe et al., 2005; Brüser et al., 2015). These
solutions are discreet, relatively low-cost (∼100e), and show
medical grade-accuracy (error <2 breaths/min) (Brüser et al.,
2015). Furthermore, promising technologies for continuous RR
monitoring exploit the modulation of radio waves and Wi-Fi
signals by respiratory-related thoracic movements (Lai et al.,
2011; Abdelnasser et al., 2015). These waves or signals can be
generated by radio sources or traditional modems for internet
connection, and have been used to monitor the RR of patients in
diﬀerent postures (seated, standing and lying on the bed) (Brüser
et al., 2015). Some of these technological solutions are incredibly
small, but are still under development and unavailable in the
market (Brüser et al., 2015).

Patients that need continuous vital sign monitoring, even
during everyday-life activities, can be equipped with wearable
devices like smart garments (e.g.,
t-shirts or chest bands
embedding sensors) (Massaroni et al., 2019b). Unlike most of
the aforementioned technologies, smart garments may provide
accurate and robust RR values even during daily activities. Several
commercial solutions are available in the market with prices

registering the breathing-related chest wall movements of the patient. (D) Radio wave or Wi-Fi signal sources and receivers can be used for registering RR values
through the modulation of the transmitted signals by respiratory-related thoracic movements (no body sensors are needed). (E) A smart garment (e.g., a strap with
conductive strain sensors) can be used to record RR continuously from the respiratory-related periodic changes in chest wall circumference, even during daily
activities (e.g., walking).

Remote Respiratory Monitoring in the Time of COVID-19

around 300e, although further eﬀorts are required to advance the
ﬁeld of respiratory monitoring with wearable devices (Massaroni
et al., 2019b). Altogether, a variety of technological solutions
are already available for the accurate remote monitoring of RR,
and a multidisciplinary approach is required to implement these
techniques eﬀectively in medical surveillance programs.

DISCUSSION

Accurate remote RR monitoring is expected to play an important
role in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It may facilitate
healthcare assistance for self-isolated COVID-19 patients as
well as for all patients that have restricted access to medical
services in this time of crisis. The improvement of remote
patient monitoring would also favor the implementation of
timely and cost-eﬀective healthcare services,
including the
early warning of patient deterioration, remote triage, and
home monitoring of COVID-19 patients discharged from
hospitals. This would help mitigate the burden on hospitals,

infection for healthcare professionals,
decrease the risk of
and thus reduce virus transmission. The availability of a
large number of accurate RR data will also contribute to
improving the development of predictive models for the risk
of hospital admission, and the development of diagnostic
and prognostic models. Finally, we argue that an accurate
remote monitoring of RR is essential and should be performed
alongside the monitoring of other vital signs. Ready-to-use
technological solutions are available to accomplish this goal.
Eﬀective RR monitoring would be an important contribution
to facing the current COVID-19 crisis and managing similar
scenarios that may possibly occur in the next months or years
(Kissler et al., 2020).

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of ﬂexible and wearable respiration sensors with emphasis
on their signiﬁcance in healthcare applications. The paper classiﬁes these sensors based on their
operating frequency distinguishing between high-frequency sensors, which operate above 10 MHz,
and low-frequency sensors, which operate below this level. The operating principles of breathing
sensors as well as the materials and fabrication techniques employed in their design are addressed.
The existing research highlights the need for robust and ﬂexible materials to enable the development
of reliable and comfortable sensors. Finally, the paper presents potential research directions and
proposes research challenges in the ﬁeld of ﬂexible and wearable respiration sensors. By identifying
emerging trends and gaps in knowledge, this review can encourage further advancements and
innovation in the rapidly evolving domain of ﬂexible and wearable sensors.

Keywords: respiration sensors; breathing sensors; ﬂexible sensors; wearable sensors

1. Introduction

Wearable sensing is an emergent technology for the monitoring of human vital signs in
various ﬁelds such as health, sports, and the military [1–3]. Nowadays, these sensors have
gained widespread usage for measuring vital signs in remote health care. Such sensors
provide an opportunity to analyze the subject’s health at their own premises, signiﬁcantly
improving the possibility of adaptive medication. Consequently, this has greatly reduced
the cost linked with conventional healthcare facilities [4]. Furthermore, the integration of
these sensors into textile ﬁber and clothes for direct connectivity with the human body is
employed for health monitoring [5]. Such ﬂexible wearable sensors are able to measure
several vital signs, including body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing
rate, etc. [6–8]. While many ﬂexible wearable respiration sensors are in their early stages of
development, there are already commercially available devices such as Hexoskin and the
Zephyr Bioharness etc. [9]. However, these systems are currently lacking in terms of robust
analysis software, comprehensive validation studies, and standardized testing protocols.
Among the vital signs, the breathing rate holds particular signiﬁcance in human
physiology, as it contains a wealth of information about a person’s health condition. The
normal respiratory rate for a healthy adult typically falls within the range of 12–20 breaths
per minute (bpm). However, in speciﬁc situations such as high-intensity exercise, the
respiratory rate may even increase to as much as 60 bpm [10]. Therefore, monitoring the
abnormal respiratory rate (<6 bpm or >24 bpm) is a better predictor of mortality than the
heart rate or hypertension. Generally, patients are observed physically to estimate their
breathing rate by counting the chest expansion and contraction for a short period of time,
which may result in false conclusions about the patient’s health [11]. Therefore, sensors that
can monitor breathing in real-time have the potential to provide important diagnostic and
monitoring tools for respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and sleep apnea [12].

Furthermore, breathing rate is an important predictor for cardiac arrest, as reported
in clinical studies [13,14]. Likewise, monitoring of the breathing rate is helpful for early
diagnosis of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. In context, an estimation algorithm
has been established for the detection of coronavirus owing to a correlation between
abnormal breathing rate and COVID-19 infection [15]. Moreover, respiration sensors
have emerged as a valuable tool for monitoring infant health in real time. These sensors
facilitate the continuous assessment of respiratory patterns, enabling timely identiﬁcation
of irregularities and facilitating prompt medical intervention [16,17].

Several approaches that employ sensors to measure breathing rate for respiratory
monitoring exist in the literature. These approaches vary on the basis of sensing tech-
niques, sensor types, and sensor placements, among other factors. The literature presents
a prevalent categorization into two main types, namely, contact and contactless sensors. As
the name implies, contact-based sensors require physical contact with the subject, while
contactless sensors measure breath parameters without physical contact using optical or
electromagnetic principles, detecting variations in light or electromagnetic waves caused by
breathing. A comprehensive overview of various sensing techniques for both contact and
non-contact methods has been presented by [18,19]. Contact-based methods encompassed
acoustic sensing, airﬂow detection, chest and abdominal movement measurement, transcu-
taneous CO2 monitoring, pulse oximetry (SpO2), and electrocardiogram-derived methods,
while non-contact methods mainly included radar-based detection, optical techniques,
ultrasound sensors, and thermal imaging.

Massaroni et al. [20] has conducted another comprehensive review of contact-based res-
piratory rate sensors. This study identiﬁed seven contact-based techniques by monitoring
the respiratory airﬂow, respiratory sounds, air temperature, air humidity, air components,
chest wall movements, and modulation of cardiac activity. Moreover, various sensor types
were highlighted, including ﬂowmeters, anemometers, ﬁber optic sensors, microphones,
thermistors, thermocouples, and a wide variety of other sensors including pyroelectric,
capacitive, resistive, nanocrystal, nanoparticle, infrared, inductive, transthoracic, inertial,
ECG, and PPG sensors, among others. While contact-based sensors offer greater precision,
they can be uncomfortable and potentially impact the breathing patterns of users. Conse-
quently, wearable sensors have emerged for continuous and seamless breath monitoring.
Vanegas et al. [21] recently conducted a systematic review of respiration sensing systems,
revealing that most authors opted for detecting chest wall movements in the wearable
category, while temperature and humidity of exhaled/inhaled air were the second and
third most commonly employed techniques.

Furthermore, these breath monitoring techniques utilize a wide range of frequencies,
allowing for their classiﬁcation based on operational frequencies. Thus, ﬂexible wearable
sensors for breathing can be broadly categorized into high-frequency systems that operate in
the microwave range and relying on changes in electromagnetic properties of surroundings
and low-frequency systems that use passive sensing mechanisms to detect breathing motion.
This classiﬁcation is especially useful in the context of Speciﬁc Absorption Rate (SAR),
which denotes the energy absorbed by human tissue when exposed to electromagnetic
radiation. Current international standards mandate SAR testing for frequencies above
4 MHz [22]; however, practical devices that require this testing, such as RFID and NFC-
based sensors, typically operate at frequencies of around 13 MHz or above. Therefore, in
this review, sensors operating above 10 MHz are classiﬁed as high-frequency sensors while
those operating below this threshold are categorized as low-frequency sensors, as depicted
in Figure 1. This paper aims to provide an overview of ﬂexible and wearable sensors for
breath rate monitoring according to the operating frequency, speciﬁcally focusing on the
popular sensing mechanisms, materials, and fabrication techniques.

For this review, conference proceedings and full-text articles were selected from
a broad search containing diverse foundations and catalogs such as Science Direct, Web
of Science, MDPI, and IEEE Xplore. Keywords were selected in each source as follows:
(Flexible OR textile) AND (wearable AND sensor) AND (respiration OR breathing). The
initial search returned 476 results, indicating that a significant number of studies have been
conducted in recent years. Consequently, we refined our search for biophysical sensors by
placing emphasis on the previously mentioned top three respiration sensing techniques
identified in [21]. Then, the results were further analyzed to eliminate duplicates, resulting
in a final count of 105 studies. All content of the subsequent sections on the sensing
mechanisms, materials, and fabrication techniques are extracted from these studies. The
organization of this paper is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 provide a detailed description
of high-frequency and low-frequency respiration sensors. In Section 4, materials and
techniques related to respiration sensors are presented and discussed. Finally, Section 5
summarizes the findings of this study and presents recommendations for future research
in this field.

2. High-Frequency Sensors

High-frequency sensors offer unique advantages such as smaller size and wireless
communication capabilities, making them suitable for various applications in healthcare
and wearable technology. Among these sensors, antenna sensors, RFID/NFC-based sen-
sors, metamaterial sensors, and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors have emerged as the
most promising candidates for high-frequency respiration monitoring. In the following sub-
sections, a brief overview of each technique is presented, including its operating principle
and associated challenges.

2.1. Antenna Sensors

Antenna sensors have become increasingly prominent in the last few years for the
monitoring of vital signs, especially for respiration. The sensing mechanism is primarily
based on two factors: chest wall movement, and displacement of air volume in the lungs.
The movement of the chest wall leads to changes in the physical dimensions of the antenna,
while the displacement of air volume alters the dielectric properties in the vicinity of the
antenna. Both of these effects result in the variation of electrical characteristics of the
antenna, such as its reﬂection coefﬁcient, resonance frequency, and radiation pattern [23].
The variations in the reﬂection coefﬁcient (S11) of the antenna sensor caused by breathing
can be measured through a vector network analyzer (VNA) and then processed for esti-
mation of the breath rate and pattern recognition. Of course, this scheme is limited to the
laboratory and valid only as a proof of concept. Another more practical method is based
on the utilization of a tuned frequency transmitter connected to an antenna sensor and
monitoring of the backscatter power intensity or received signal strength indicator (RSSI) at
the receiver end. The RSSI varies, as the impedance of antenna changes during breathing;
therefore, the effective transmitted power varies accordingly.

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

Various types of ﬂexible and wearable antenna-based respiration sensors have been
developed for respiration monitoring. For instance, an embroidered meandering dipole
antenna-based sensor was integrated into a commercially available t-shirt that detects
resonance frequency shifts induced by chest movements during breathing [24], as shown
in Figure 2a. In another study, a wearable strain sensor based on a ﬂexible and sinusoidal
dipole antenna was fabricated utilizing a conductive polymer material [25], illustrated
in Figure 2b. Similarly, ﬂexible and spiral dipole antennas have been designed using
multi-material ﬁbers for respiration monitoring [26], as shown in Figure 2c. Moreover,
a low-proﬁle fully textile antenna was used as a passive e-textile respiration sensor that
relied on the interaction between the human body and the antenna to detect changes in
dielectric properties induced by breathing in [27]. This antenna was implemented using
a conductive fabric on a felt fabric substrate, providing simplicity and compatibility with
different textiles, as shown in Figure 2d.

Commercial RF platforms such as RFID and Bluetooth have been employed for
wireless sensing by utilizing the variations in the received signal strength indicator
(RSSI). For instance, Patron et al. presented a sensor that employed knitted antennas and
inductively coupled RFID tags for comfortable and battery-free monitoring of respiration
patterns [28]. Figure 2e depicts a complete RFID-based system for the simultaneous
respiration monitoring of multiple persons [29]. Likewise, a number of portable wireless
communication platforms were presented in [30,31] that integrate antennas with Blue-
tooth modules in wearable t-shirts, as shown in Figure 2f. This enables non-invasive
and contactless breath detection, with potential applications in medical diagnostics and
respiratory condition monitoring.

soidal dipole antenna [25]; (c) spiral dipole antenna [26]; (d) circular patch antenna [27]; (e) RFID–
based respiration system [29]; (f) Bluetooth–based respiration system [31].

Nevertheless, the development of ﬂexible and wearable antenna sensors is accom-
panied by several signiﬁcant challenges. First, achieving conformity to complex surfaces
such as the human body poses a key hurdle. These antennas must be able to adapt and
conform to irregular and curved surfaces while maintaining reliable signal reception and
transmission. Second, balancing performance and efﬁciency in a compact and ﬂexible

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

form factor is crucial, as the human body acts as a very lossy medium that absorbs and
attenuates electromagnetic signals. This results in decreased antenna efﬁciency, reduced
signal transmission range, and altered radiation patterns. Therefore, wearable antennas
need to exhibit high radiation efﬁciency, wide bandwidth, and reliable communication
capabilities by carefully tackling these challenges.

In addition, the safety of subjects is a crucial aspect to consider in the application
of antenna sensors. Compliance with speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) limits is essential to
ensure the well-being of users. It can be observed from Figure 2 that dipole antennas are
employed mostly for sensing in the UHF and ISM frequency bands due to their simple
geometry and ease of fabrication. However, these antennas radiate a substantial amount of
power toward the subject; thus, further investigation into other antenna types that have
better safety features for the end users is required.

2.2. RFID/NFC Sensors

Wireless transmission of sensor data can be achieved through various technologies,
including radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), near-ﬁeld communication (NFC), and
Bluetooth. However, when comparing RFID/NFC technology to Bluetooth one notable
advantage is the potential for battery-free communication. The principle of operation
for RFID is backscattering, where the tag receives energy from the reader’s transmission
and uses it to send back a reply. In this case, the sensors can derive power from the
electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld generated by a remote reader.

2.2.1. RFID Sensors

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, radio-frequency identiﬁcation
devices (RFID) sensors have gained popularity for wearable sensing. In particularly, passive
UHF RFID sensors have become used widely due to their small size and lack of power
requirements. These sensors have the advantage of being lightweight and comfortable due
to their ﬂexible nature. Typically, RFID systems are utilized for sensing applications in two
manners. The ﬁrst involves the measurement of back-scattered power intensity, while the
second entails the transmission of sensor data towards the reader.

For respiration measurements, RFID sensors have been mostly used as strain sensors
utilizing the principle of backscattering. In this case, the main sensing element is an antenna
which is specially designed according to the impedance of RFID chip and fabricated on
a ﬂexible or textile material. When a strain force is applied to an RFID tag, the physical
deformation of the embedded antenna causes a shift in its resonant frequency. This results
in a variation in the backscattered power (RSSI) transmitted from the passive RFID tag,
which can be used as a metric for detecting mechanical deformations. Thus, RFID-based
respiration sensors are designed by correlating the RSSI variation to the mechanical defor-
mation of the RFID antenna. This approach has been demonstrated in various studies for
monitoring respiration rate and detecting breathing patterns [16,28,32,33], as discussed in
the previous section.

Apart from RSSI, RFID technology is utilized to transmit data from other sensors
towards the reader. In a study on graphene-based respiration sensing, the AMS SL900A
microchip was employed for this purpose [34]. The SL900A is an Electronic Product
Code (EPC) tag that operates in both semi-passive mode (battery-assisted passive) and
fully passive mode (without battery) and exhibits power sensitivities of −6.9 dBmW and
−15 dBmW in these respective power modes. The EPC chip features a direct connection to
the antenna along with a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of controlling two
external analog sensors. Additionally, it incorporates an integrated temperature sensor with
a programmable dynamic range of −40 to 150 °C. This demonstrates that a wearable RFID
system with such capabilities enables simultaneous multi-parameter sensing, speciﬁcally
for humidity and temperature measurements, for subsequent respiration monitoring.

2.2.2. NFC Sensors

NFC is a speciﬁc subset of RFID technology that is designed for short-range wireless
systems. One signiﬁcant advantage of NFC over conventional RFID is its ability to facil-
itate peer-to-peer communication between an NFC-based system and any NFC-enabled
smartphone acting as a remote reader. This feature makes NFC technology accessible
to individual users and thus expands its potential applications. Similar to RFID, the
backscattering technique can be applied to NFC for sensing purposes as well.

An embroidered inductive strain sensor was introduced in [35] for respiration sens-
ing that comprises two embroidered planar coils connected in series, with their mutual
inductance being inﬂuenced by their relative positions. These coils can serve as antennas
for NFC tags that modulate the carrier wave from the reader according to the inductance
variations of the sensor, enabling wireless extraction of sensing information. Moreover,
an NFC-based smart bandage incorporating wireless strain and temperature sensors is
presented in [36]. The bandage utilizes a battery-free NFC transponder (RF430FRL152H) as
an intermediary between the sensors and a smartphone application. This enables the acqui-
sition and transmission of data from both sensors. The smartphone application can power
the system and provide real-time data acquisition from the sensors at a distance of 25 mm.
The authors proposed potential healthcare applications for the smart bandage, including
the assessment of respiratory diseases through its usage as a wearable strain sensor.

Despite the inherent ﬂexibility and lack of power requirements of passive RFID tags,
a limitation of these tags is the inclusion of an electronic chip. This limits their large-scale
production for wearable applications and renders them susceptible to harsh environmental
conditions. Therefore, the future of RFID wearable sensing lies in chipless technology,
which is more robust and feasible for production due to the absence of any electronic
component [37].

2.3. Metamaterial Sensors

Electromagnetic metamaterials are man-made materials comprised of structures with
electromagnetic properties that are deliberately engineered to offer a range of responses that
are difﬁcult or impossible to achieve in naturally occurring materials or composites. The
growing popularity of metamaterials in sensing applications is evident from the increasing
number of published works utilizing these engineered structures [38]. In these applications,
changes in the resonance frequency or amplitude at resonance are typically used to detect
variations in the measured parameter. However, it is worth noting that only a small number
of studies in the existing literature have employed metamaterials to design ﬂexible and
wearable sensors for respiration monitoring.

2.3.1. Frequency Selective Surfaces

Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSS) are two-dimensional planar structures consist-
ing of periodic arrays of sub-wavelength elements. They are designed to selectively
transmit or reflect electromagnetic waves based on their frequency. FSSs are widely
utilized in microwave frequency filters, radar absorbing materials (RAMs), and antenna
reflectors [39]. For respiration sensing, a wireless apnea detector was proposed in [40]
that utilizes a passive respiration sensor to measure the changes in airflow temperature
during breathing, as shown in Figure 3a. A transponder based on a modulated FSS is em-
ployed that uses a backscattered field technique for sensing and is composed of an array
of dipoles loaded with varactor diodes. The resistance of thermal sensor changes due to
the variations in airflow temperature during breathing which modulates the backscatter
response. An algorithm based on peak detection has been used to calculate real-time
respiration and apnea intervals. However, this system requires a battery to polarize
the FSS, and it is rather uncomfortable for the patient due to the many interconnected
devices worn on the face and head.

Traditional frequency selective surfaces used for sensing present certain limitations in
terms of flexibility, as the materials and structures used are rigid. Therefore, liquid metal-based
technologies [43] and textile-based substrates [44] are feasible options that can be explored for
designing flexible metamaterials for wearable applications, as depicted in Figure 3d,e.

2.3.2. Spiral Resonator Tag

Planar spiral structures (SRs) are commonly used as lumped inductors in microwave
circuits and serve as a fundamental element for metamaterials [45]. The inductance of
a spiral is determined by its geometry (such as square, circular, or polygonal), number of
turns, turn width, and spacing between turns. A breath rate sensor based on an SR tag is
illustrated in Figure 3b; it is printed on a thin, ﬂexible textile substrate suitable for wearable
applications [41]. The sensor detects the respiratory movement of the abdomen during
inspiration and expiration. A microstrip probing loop serves as the reader antenna and
measures the variation in the real part of input impedance caused by the change in the
normal distance between the probing loop and the SR tag. Thus, the respiratory rate is
obtained by analyzing the amplitude-modulated signal captured by the probe. The sensor
was employed to experimentally measure the breath rate of a test subject in a quasi-real
scenario. To enhance the capabilities of the presented sensor, however, future advancements
should focus on transitioning from quasi-real environments to a fully operational settings
by integrating a signal acquisition board.

2.3.3. Surface Plasmons Resonators

Spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are electromagnetic modes that are highly
conﬁned and can be realized using various techniques such as textured metal surfaces,
thin metal layers, and conductive textiles [44,46,47]. These modes can be used to design
wearable sensors by detecting changes in localized electromagnetic ﬁelds. Although these
modes are associated with strong subwavelength conﬁnement, which is a characteristic
feature of LSP resonances, they extend into the surrounding space evanescently, enabling
interactions for sensing and mode excitation. Figure 3c shows the structure of a typical
spoof LSP resonance sensor with a patterned conductive structure.

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

A wearable textile sensor based on LSP resonance was proposed in [48] for vital sign
monitoring such as breathing and heartbeat. The sensor is placed on the chest and excited
remotely through a curved dipole antenna. Small movements of the chest during breathing
and heartbeat change the resonant frequency of the sensor, which is remotely monitored
from the excitation source. Moreover, an energy-efﬁcient and secure wireless body sensor
network (WBSN) interconnected through radio surface plasmons on metamaterial textiles
was introduced [44], as illustrated in Figure 3e. This conductive fabric shows a three-fold
improvement in transmission efﬁciency compared to conventional radio networks. Wireless
communications remain conﬁned to within 10 cm of the body, ensuring greater privacy
and security. This textile can be used in conjunction with a range of sensors, including
respiration sensors, for the monitoring of vital signs.

Resonators relying on surface plasmons generally have a very high quality factor,
as the electrical ﬁeld is conﬁned in a very limited space. However, these sensors face
challenges in terms of the complexity of their fabrication and sensitivity to the environment.
Therefore, further research is needed to ensure their reliable performance in the context of
wearable sensing.

2.4. Fiber Bragg Gratings

Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are well suited for measuring biophysical pa-
rameters, including the respiratory behavior of the chest and abdominal regions. These
sensors are comprised of a fiber optic grating that reflects a specific wavelength of
light [49], as shown in Figure 4a. When the FBG undergoes strain or displacement
caused by breathing, its reflected wavelength experiences a corresponding shift. This
shift is directly proportional to the applied strain or displacement, enabling FBG sensors
to accurately measure and monitor breathing patterns. Various applications of FBG
sensors for the monitoring of vital signs are illustrated in Figure 4b, including cardiac
and respiration activities [50]. Koyama et. al demonstrated in a study that FBG sensors
can efficiently detect respiratory strain in the abdomen, chest, and shoulder regions [51],
as shown in Figure 4c.

Figure 4. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors: (a) working principle of FBG [49]; (b) application in vital
signs monitoring [50]; (c) single FBG respiratory sensor [51]; (d) multiple FBG respiratory sensors [52];
(e) monitoring neck movement and respiration [53].

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

FBG sensors are especially advantageous during MRI testing thanks to their immunity
to strong magnetic ﬁelds. A study focusing on the design and assessment of an MR-
compatible smart textile utilized six FBGs [54]. The objective was to non-intrusively moni-
tor and characterize a patient’s respiration. The study employed the chest wall kinematics
during breathing to optimize the positioning of FBGs on the textile and improve their sen-
sitivity in monitoring compartmental volume changes. Figure 4d illustrates a similar study
in which the positioning of FBGs on the textile was determined using an optoelectronic
system [52]. Another study evaluated an MR-compatible smart textile with FBG sensors for
monitoring respiratory and cardiac activities during apnea and quiet breathing [55]. The
results showed that accurate measurement of respiratory parameters and heart rate could
be obtained without image artifacts in the MR environment.

Furthermore, elastic belts integrated with optical ﬁbers for monitoring breathing activ-
ities were studied in [56]. The aim was to assess the impact of differences in the participants’
positions on the breathing patterns detected by the optical ﬁbers. Experiments were con-
ducted using FBG sensor arrays to monitor breathing patterns. Two sets of FBG arrays,
each comprising ﬁve sensors, were placed at speciﬁc locations on the body, namely, the
abdomen and chest. The diversity technique was employed to enhance detection accuracy.
The results showed consistent accuracy for individuals, though variations were observed
among the participants. In the same year, a wearable system was proposed by utilizing
two FBG sensors positioned on the neck to monitor neck movements and breathing [53], as
depicted in Figure 4e. This system effectively captured ﬂexion extension, axial rotation, and
respiratory frequency parameters, showing comparable performance to optical reference
systems. The estimated mean and breath-by-breath respiratory frequency values exhibited
errors ≤6.09% and ≤1.90% during quiet breathing and tachypnea, respectively, demonstrat-
ing high accuracy. Additionally, a 3D printed sensor using FBG technology was introduced
for respiratory and heart rate monitoring in [57]. Each sensor was equipped with a single
FBG fully encapsulated within a 3D-printable ﬂexible material during printing.

The biggest challenge associated with FBG sensors is that the optical ﬁbers are typically
rigid and fragile. Therefore, they need to be encapsulated in a material that can provide
protection, ﬂexibility, and biocompatibility in order to make them suitable for ﬂexible and
wearable applications. Such encapsulation additionally shields the FBG sensor from exter-
nal inﬂuences such as moisture, mechanical stress, or bending which could compromise its
performance or usability.

3. Low-Frequency Sensors

Various low-frequency sensors have been developed to enable non-invasive and
continuous breath monitoring. These sensors are often characterized as simple and passive
devices that typically operate at sub-megahertz frequencies and do not require an external
power source for their operation. They are relatively straightforward in terms of their
design and implementation, often consisting of basic lumped component designs such
as capacitors, resistors, coils, or electrodes. The following section discusses the most
commonly used low-frequency techniques for ﬂexible and wearable respiration sensors.

3.1. Capacitive Sensors

Capacitive sensors are a type of flexible wearable sensor that has shown promising
scope for monitoring breathing and respiration. The working principle of capacitive sensors
relies on variations in capacitance due to changes in electrode dimensions, the separation
distance between electrodes, or dielectric properties. These changes allow the capacitive
sensor to detect physical quantities such as strain, pressure, or humidity. Capacitive sensors
on the human body have been utilized in various ways to detect breathing. They can measure
chest expansion and contraction during respiration by detecting changes in capacitance;
additionally, these sensors can be employed to detect air humidity from exhaled breaths
as a means of monitoring respiration. Another approach is to measure the pressure on the
abdomen and chest during exhalation, which can be used to monitor respiratory movements.

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

The simplicity of the working principle of capacitive sensors has led researchers to explore
various fabrication techniques and materials to improve their flexibility and sensitivity for wear-
able applications. In [58], a flexible capacitive sensor with high sensitivity, a large sensing range,
and good stability was developed. This sensor utilizes a micro-structured polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) film embedded with multi-walled carbon nanotubes as the conductive electrode and
a smooth PDMS film as the dielectric layer. The sensor was successfully applied to monitor
arterial pulse waves and breathing. In another work, the design of highly sensitive capacitive
sensor for wearable sensing applications was reported; this sensor uses conductive textile
electrodes and polyurethane (PU) foams as the dielectric layer. Unlike previous works that in-
volved complex fabrication processes, this sensor employs a simple and cost-effective technique,
with a microporous PU foam serving as the dielectric material [59]. A compression sensor is
illustrated in Figure 5a, where the porous Ecoflex dielectric is placed between embroidered
electrodes and changes in capacitance were measured to assess respiration [60].

Furthermore, a facemask with an inter-digital embroidered capacitor was proposed
for respiration monitoring in [61], as shown in Figure 5b. The sensor operates by exploit-
ing the humidity of exhaled air to monitor respiration. A paper-based wearable screen
printed sensor was proposed in [62] for respiration monitoring, particularly for patients
affected by SARS-CoV-2. The sensor utilizes traditional screen printing methods to fab-
ricate interdigitated electrodes composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite on a paper substrate. The paper substrate
functions as a humidity-sensitive material due to its hygroscopic properties. As a result,
the capacitance of the sensor varies in response to changes in the dielectric constant during
inhalation and exhalation. In another study, a ﬂexible paper-based capacitive pressure
sensor was fabricated using common daily materials such as paper, polyester conductive
tape, and polyimide tape [10]. This sensor has a wide pressure detection range and was
able to demonstrate successful application in various scenarios, including nasal respiration
analysis. In another study, a capacitive sensor was made using a co-doped barium titanate
dielectric material and palladium–silver electrodes [63]. In addition, the screen-printing
and micro-dispensing construction methods were evaluated. The resulting sensors demon-
strated suitable characteristics for respiration monitoring, with the screen-printed sensors
ultimately chosen for experimentation and prototyping due to their greater dynamic range.

mask [61]; (c) PDMS composites, reprinted with permission from ref. [64]. 2021, Elsevier; (d) carbon
nanoﬁbers [65]; (e) embroidered electrodes [66].

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

Similarly, a sensor for wearable electronics was fabricated in [64] using hierarchically
porous PDMS composites with a simple and cost-effective method of screen printing, as
shown in Figure 5c. The resulting sensor exhibits a wide pressure measurement range,
high sensitivity, and ﬂexibility, making it suitable for various applications in wearable
electronics, including respiration. Furthermore, a smart face mask with a dual-sensing
mode respiration sensor was presented for recognizing multiple respiration patterns in [65].
By incorporating three-dimensional carbon nanoﬁber mats, this sensor enables simulta-
neous pressure and temperature sensing, allowing for real-time recognition and accurate
monitoring of up to eight respiration patterns, as depicted in Figure 5d. This mask has
potential applications in health monitoring and early detection of breathing-related dis-
eases. Moreover, a fabrication strategy for a multi-functional e-textile based on polypyrrole
(PPy) and rose-like silver ﬂower-decorated knitted cotton/spandex fabric (KCSF) is pre-
sented in [67]. This e-textile was then used in the construction of a capacitive sensor with
an ultra-wide working pressure range and high sensitivity. In addition, Ecoﬂex rubber has
been effectively used as a dielectric in capacitive sensors for respiratory measurements.
Wearable capacitive pressure sensors have been developed for human activity and respira-
tion monitoring, with Ecoﬂex and silver nanowires respectively serving as the dielectric
material and electrodes [68,69].

Kang et al. developed a respiration sensor utilizing a variable parallel-plate capacitive
design and incorporating nonwoven fabrics [70]. This sensor comprises both stretchable
and non-stretchable fabric segments that respond to respiratory movements, leading to
alterations in sensor length. In [71], a capacitive sensor was developed based on textiles
designed to be worn around the chest as a belt for monitoring the respiration rate. This
sensor utilizes the change in capacitance resulting from the expansion of the fabric during
respiration, achieving a high precision level in the micrometer range. A zinc ion hybrid
supercapacitor (ZHS) with a double-crosslinked hydrogel electrolyte was developed in [72],
serving as both an energy storage device and a self-powered sensor for human movement
and breathing detection. In [66], a respiration sensor was proposed based on a parallel
capacitor embroidered on textiles. This respiration capacitor was characterized using
a silver thread and a porous Ecoﬂex material to simulate air from the lungs. The study
then examined actual breathing patterns, including normal breathing, deep breathing,
hyperventilation, and apnea, using a clothing-type respiration sensor, as shown in Figure 5e.
Conversely, capacitive sensors have a number of limitations on their use in respiration
sensing. One such limitation is their sensitivity to environmental factors such as humidity
and temperature, which can affect the accuracy of the measurements. Additionally, the
placement of electrodes on the textile substrate may introduce variability in the signal due
to movement or displacement during breathing. Therefore, calibration and compensation
techniques are necessary to account for these variations.

3.2. Resistive Sensors

Resistive sensors for respiration monitoring employ different sensing mechanisms,
including strain sensing, temperature sensing, and humidity sensing. Strain sensing in-
volves ﬂexible materials that changes their resistance in response to respiratory movements,
thereby enabling measurement of the respiratory volume or rate. Most strain sensors
employ resistive techniques due to the direct proportionality between the resistance of
conductive materials and the strain. For instance, a respiration sensor based on stretchable
conducting fabric was developed in [73] to detect changes in electrical resistance correspond-
ing to tensile strain during inhalation and exhalation. Moreover, several hydrogel-based
ﬂexible strain sensors with self-healing capabilities and high sensitivity have been proposed
for human motion and respiration monitoring [74,75]. Textile strain sensors have been
designed for conductive yarns by combining them with elastic yarns or making them
elastic by coating them with carbon-ﬁlled silicon [76,77]. Flexible dual parameter sensors
with hierarchical porous structures have been introduced to enhance the functionality of
wearable devices for fully decoupled pressure and temperature sensing [78], as shown in

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

Figure 6a. A ﬂexible and perforated nasal-based respiratory sensing system was introduced
in [79] and was found to have improved air convection efﬁciency and thermal sensitivity, as
shown in Figure 6b. Platinum was selected as the sensing material due to its stable physical
and chemical properties. Moreover, its resistance–temperature characteristics exhibit ex-
cellent linearity and rapid thermal response. A printable wet-resistive textile strain sensor
was introduced in [80] and demonstrated high sensitivity and mechanical durability for
robust wearable electronics, as depicted in Figure 6c. This composite strain sensor was
successfully printed onto a tracksuit to enable real-time monitoring of respiration and arm
motion signals.

Various ﬂexible humidity sensors based on different materials have been explored for
vital sign monitoring by measuring impedance. Highly sensitive textile-based humidity
sensors employing graphene oxide/Polypyrrole composites have been developed for real-
time respiration monitoring [81,82]. In particular, the ﬁeld of humidity sensing has seen
advancements, with printed ﬂexible humidity sensors utilizing cellulose nanoﬁber-based
composites [83]. A ﬂexible humidity sensor based on a poly-3D hollow ﬁber membrane
was proposed in [84] and was found to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability
for monitoring physiological activity. In [85], a graphene oxide-based breath sensor was
demonstrated to have high sensitivity to humidity and potential applications in detect-
ing lung cancer and sleep apnea. Another study focused on a Coolmax/graphene-oxide
functionalized textile humidity sensor with ultrafast response designed for monitoring
human activities [86]. In [87], an ultrasensitive humidity sensing capability was achieved
using a tin disulﬁde/graphene oxide nanoﬂower composite with ultrafast response, low
hysteresis, and good reversibility, making it promising for wearable applications, as shown
in Figure 6d. Additionally, few-layer NiPS3 and ZIS nanosheet-based ﬂexible humidity sen-
sors have been developed that offer high selectivity along with rapid response and recovery
times for real-time monitoring of respiration and environmental conditions [88,89]. Several
other ﬂexible and wearable resistive sensors have been designed employing composites of
polymers, carbon, bi-metallic nanoalloys, and thermoplastics [90–93].

Despite the potential advantages, resistive sensors are susceptible to drift and hystere-
sis, leading to potential inaccuracies in measurements. Moreover, unintended ﬂuctuations
in electrical resistance may arise as a consequence of variations in the ambient temper-

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

ature and humidity conditions. Therefore, signal processing techniques are necessary
in order to ensure accurate respiratory monitoring, address noise, and extract relevant
respiratory information.

3.3. Magnetic Induction Sensors

Magnetic Induction (MI) is a non-contact technique used to measure changes in the
impedance distribution of an object. It relies on the electromagnetic coupling between a coil
and an object in close proximity. Human tissue is characterized as an electrical medium that
is both inhomogeneous and anisotropic in nature. The impedance distribution within the
thorax is inﬂuenced by physiological activities such as breathing, which can be attributed
to various factors, including volume changes and displacement of organ boundaries.
Currently, three primary categories of ﬂexible inductive sensors are extensively employed:
eddy current sensors, mutual-inductive sensors, and self-inductive sensors.

In the eddy current method, the coil is driven by an alternating current, generating
a primary alternating magnetic ﬁeld that penetrates the conductive medium surrounding
it, thereby inducing eddy currents within the medium. These eddy currents in turn
generate a secondary alternating magnetic ﬁeld that interacts with the primary ﬁeld,
resulting in changes in the coil’s impedance. These changes are directly related to the
impedance distribution of the object. When the coil is positioned in front of the thorax,
the thorax acts as the object under test and the coil’s impedance varies in response to the
variation in thoracic impedance distribution caused by the movement of the lungs. In [94],
a system was introduced for long-term monitoring of respiration and pulse. The system
utilizes four non-contact sensors based on magnetic eddy current induction; these are
integrated into a shirt, as shown in Figure 7a. The effectiveness of this system in monitoring
respiration and pulse was demonstrated through measurements conducted on healthy
volunteers. Similarly, a ﬂexible device for non-contact monitoring of respiration and pulse
was presented in [95]. It combines magnetic induction for respiratory monitoring and
reﬂective photoplethysmography (rPPG) for pulse detection, enabling enhanced signal
coverage. Sensor signals are processed by a microcontroller and wirelessly transmitted via
Bluetooth to a display unit such as a personal computer or Android device. The device can
easily be placed in a shirt or jacket pocket to monitor vital signs.

In addition, inductive sensors can measure physical quantities such as displacement
and pressure with high sensitivity utilizing the principles of mutual inductance. Inductive-
based displacement sensors utilize electromagnetic induction to measure and monitor
object displacement or position. These sensors generate an alternating magnetic ﬁeld using
a coil; the movement of the object induces a change in the magnetic ﬁeld, allowing for
displacement measurement. An embroidered inductive strain sensor was proposed in [35]
fabricated using off-the-shelf conductive yarns that can be woven into clothing such as
shirts or sweaters. The sensor consists of two embroidered planar coils connected in series,
with their mutual inductance affected by their relative positions. The displacement between
the coils alters the inductance, enabling the sensor to function as a strain sensor. Moreover,
a paper-based self-inductive folding displacement sensor (PSIFS) was proposed in [96]; this
sensor operates on the principle of inductance variation caused by the three-dimensional
deformation of a planar inductor coil, as depicted in Figure 7b. This research focuses on
investigating the structural design principles concerning two key aspects of sensitivity and
size. The PSIFS has demonstrated the capability to accurately identify and differentiate
various breathing states and motion states of human joints.

Magnetic induction sensors used in respiration monitoring can be susceptible to
measurement errors caused by external electromagnetic interference. It is essential to
employ calibration and compensation techniques to mitigate variations in the magnetic
ﬁeld arising from different body positions or environmental factors. Furthermore, careful
consideration of the sensor’s design and placement relative to the body is crucial to optimize
measurement accuracy.

3.4. Piezoelectric Sensors

Piezoelectric sensors are fabricated using piezoelectric materials, which exhibit an in-
ternal polarization phenomenon when subjected to an external force. This phenomenon
leads to the appearance of positive and negative charges on the surfaces of the piezoelectric
material, resulting in the generation of a piezoelectric potential. Upon removal of the
external force, the polarization phenomenon disappears. Thus, sensors can be designed
by using piezoelectric sensors during respiration monitoring to detect variations in the
electrical signal.

3.4.1. Piezoelectric Sensors and Generators

Several studies have proposed the use of piezoelectric sensors as part of multi-
functional sensing technologies. These studies aim to integrate multiple smart functions
into wearable sensors by employing hybrid mechanisms [97–99]. In addition, researchers
have explored the development of self-powered sensors for portable and wearable devices,
aiming to overcome the limitations of operational time, rigid characteristics, and bulky size
associated with conventional power sources. For instance, a ﬂexible hybrid nanogenerator
was presented in [100] that combines a solar cell, a transparent triboelectric nanogenerator,
and a piezoelectric nanogenerator.

Similarly, Zhu et al. designed a self-powered hybrid electronic skin that combines
triboelectric and piezoelectric effects to enable wearable multi-sensing [101], as shown
in Figure 7c. In [102], a nanogenerator was developed and utilized as a ﬂexible active
respiratory sensor, and ﬂexible piezoelectric smart-textile sensor and energy harvester was
developed in [103]. This sensor demonstrated its effectiveness and sensitivity in detecting
activities such as falling water droplets, footsteps, and breathing. A nasal-based sensor
based on a thin ﬁlm of piezoelectric polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) was proposed in [104]
for the purpose of monitoring respiratory patterns. The cantilever beam of the sensor is
affected by the air exhaled from the nostrils and generates a dynamic voltage signal based
on the piezoelectric effect.

inductive displacement sensor [96]; (c) piezoelectric multi–modal sensor, reprinted with permission

3.4.2. Piezoelectric Resonators

Piezoelectric-on-substrate (TPoS) refers to a speciﬁc type of piezoelectrically actuated
resonators designed with a piezoelectric layer on top of a substrate layer. The incorporation
of the substrate layer enhances power handling capabilities and improves the quality
factor of the resonator. For respiratory monitoring applications, it is crucial to have a TPoS
resonator that exhibits high sensitivity to changes in respiration ﬂow as well as a high
electromechanical coupling and quality factor.

A wireless sensor utilizing a thin-ﬁlm piezoelectric-on-substrate (TPoS) resonator was
employed in [107] for respiratory monitoring. Such passive wireless sensors consist of
an antenna and a resonator; the resonator detects the respiration proﬁle. The resonator
used in this investigation consistsed of a stack of Molybdenum, Aluminum, and Nitride
deposited on a diamond substrate. During inhalation and exhalation, TPoS resonators
experience two distinct effects. First, the temperature difference between the exhaled breath
and the resonator induces a frequency shift due to alterations in the elastic properties
of the resonator’s constituent materials. Second, the condensation of water vapor from
exhalation onto the resonator’s surface causes a frequency drift. The TPoS resonator is
integrated with an RFID tag’s antenna, and respiration monitoring is achieved through
backscattering techniques.

The successful integration of piezoelectric materials into wearable sensors requires meticu-
lous design considerations in order to ensure mechanical stability and durability. The accuracy
of measurements can be compromised by sensor drift and noise, necessitating the implemen-
tation of suitable signal-processing techniques. Calibration and compensation methods are
imperative to address individual variations and ensure consistent and reliable measurements.

3.5. Bioimpedance Sensors

Bioimpedance sensors for respiration monitoring operate based on the principle of
measuring changes in electrical impedance caused by respiratory movements. These
sensors typically consist of electrodes that are placed on the skin surface, creating a closed
electrical circuit [105], as shown in Figure 7d. When the person breathes, the expansion
and contraction of the chest or abdomen lead to changes in the thoracic impedance. These
changes in impedance are caused by variations in the conductivity and volume of the
underlying tissues and organs. Thus, respiratory patterns can be continuously tracked by
measuring these impedance variations.

Impedance sensors play a crucial role in breath monitoring, offering a non-invasive
and continuous approach that can track respiratory patterns and gather valuable health
information. Several articles have explored the use of such ﬂexible sensors to monitor phys-
iological activities. For instance, a wearable smart clothing system was proposed in [108]
integrating numerous sensors for accurate respiratory rate estimation in a home-care moni-
toring context. Additionally, a portable physiological signal recorder was designed and
implemented in [109], achieving a 24 h operating time and focusing on electrocardiography,
bioimpedance, and user activity measurements. Moreover, the development of a wearable
monitoring system named Wealthy enabled continuous remote monitoring of electrocar-
diogram and impedance pneumography signals and was able to discriminate between
different breathing patterns using piezoresistive fabric sensors [76]. In [110], a textile
sensing system was employed for the simultaneous acquisition of electrocardiogram and
impedance pneumography signals using fabric sensors and electrodes.

In addition, a wearable scheme incorporating an electrical impedance tomography
(EIT) belt has been designed with a novel active electrode architecture, high image frame
rate, and wide operating bandwidth, enhancing the neonatal thorax monitoring for vital
signs [17]. Moreover, the integration of MEMS stethoscope, ambient noise sensing, ECG,
impedance pneumography, and nine-axial actigraphy into a wearable multimodal stetho-
scope patch in [111] allowed for long-term auscultation and high-quality signal acquisition.
Additionally, a high frame rate wearable EIT system utilizing active electrode ASICs was
developed in [112], achieving accurate measurement of EIT signals for lung respiration and

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

heart rate monitoring. Lastly, an energy-efﬁcient and reconﬁgurable sensor IC was imple-
mented in [113] to improve bioimpedance spectroscopy and ECG recording in wearable
health devices by enhancing the accuracy of signal measurements.

Bioimpedance measurements are sensitive to electrode placement and contact quality,
and require careful attention to ensure consistent and reliable measurements. Calibration
procedures and algorithms are necessary in order to accurately interpret impedance changes
related to respiration and distinguish them from other physiological signals.

3.6. Inertial Sensors

The primary characteristic of respiration involves the movement of air in and out of
the lungs, which results from the expansion and contraction of the lungs. The associated
ribcage movement can be detected through inertial sensors [106,114], as evident from
Figure 7e. These sensors offer versatility and non-obtrusiveness, making them suitable
for various applications and providing a reliable and cost-effective method of collecting
motion data. A wearable multi-sensor patch was developed for the purpose of detecting
and recognizing human breathing patterns in [115]. This multi-sensor patch, composed
of an accelerometer and a pressure sensor, was shown to accurately measure breathing-
related inertial motion and muscle stretch when attached near the diaphragm. Through
analysis of different breathing motions, including inhalation, exhalation, normal breathing,
and breath-holding conditions, the breathing frequency and normal breathing rate were
determined using an accelerometer and ﬂexible capacitive pressure sensors.

However, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are mostly incorporated to capture mo-
tion data and facilitate activity monitoring in conjunction with other sensors. For instance,
the NeoWear system was developed to monitor neonatal vital signs using a sensor belt
which comprises a pressure sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) [116]. This
system detects respiration rate and apnea events by analyzing the pressure and movement
data of the respective sensors. The accuracy of inertia-based methods for detecting body
movements can be affected by motion artifacts. In the context of respiration monitoring,
motion artifacts can undermine the ability to accurately capture and analyze respiratory
patterns, potentially leading to erroneous or incomplete results. Therefore, mitigating and
minimizing the impact of motion artifacts is a critical consideration when developing and
implementing inertial sensors for respiration monitoring.

4. Manufacturing Materials and Fabrication Techniques

Many materials and techniques have been explored to date for the fabrication of
ﬂexible wearable sensors. The fundamental requirement for these sensors is to exhibit
improved performance when applied to the human body while simultaneously possessing
material ﬂexibility, biocompatibility, and user comfort. Sensors are primarily comprised of
two components, namely, the substrate and the sensing elements, which are connected by
metallic interconnectors. This section provides a brief overview of substrate and sensing
materials utilized in the context of respiration sensors, as depicted in Figure 8.

4.1. Substrate Materials

Selection of the substrate plays a crucial role in designing wearable sensors, as the
substrate is essential for ensuring that the sensor can conform to the body’s contours
and withstand its movements while maintaining optimal performance and providing
a satisfactory user experience [117].

4.1.1. Polymeric Materials

Polymer-based materials have been extensively used as substrates for ﬂexible sensors.
These are heavy-weight molecules composed of repeating units that exhibit distinct char-
acteristics based on their internal bonds. Polymers offer tunable chemical, structural, and
electrical properties, making them attractive candidates for sensing applications. Several
types of polymer-based materials have been used as substrates for ﬂexible wearable respi-

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

ration sensors. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a silicone-based elastomer known for its
excellent ﬂexibility, biocompatibility, and optical transparency, and is the most commonly
used substrate material for wearable sensors [58,64]. It has also been used as an encapsula-
tion material for protecting fragile sensors such as FBGs [57]. In addition, Polyurethane
(PU) has been used for respiration sensors [59,91], as it is softer than PDMS. Polyimide
(PI) is another prevalent substrate material for wearable sensors, which has been used
for ﬂexible wearable sensing due to its high tensile strength and ﬂexibility [10,118,119].
Furthermore, rubbers such as Ecoﬂex are employed for breathing applications, representing
a skin-safe substrate material [68,69]. These rubbers have modulus similar to that of human
skin, which enhances their adaptability to the human body.

Figure 8. Typical ﬂexible materials for wearable respiration sensors.

4.1.2. Textiles and Fabrics

Wearable sensor technologies have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements in utilizing
fabric and textile materials as substrates. These materials offer ﬂexibility, durability, and
comfort, making them highly suitable for a wide range of applications. Flexible sensors
integrated into textile materials offer comfort, wearability, and ease of use. Several articles
have focused on the integration of sensors into fabric and textiles to enable real-time
monitoring of vital signs and respiration. For instance, wearable antennas and sensor tags
are embroidered or printed on fabric substrates, ensuring unobtrusive and comfortable
monitoring experiences [24,41]. These materials have been successfully utilized in various
applications, such as knitted antennas that utilize wool, lycra, and conductive fabrics to
achieve both elasticity and functionality [16,28]. Cotton T-shirts serve as a particularly
ideal platform for such applications, providing both comfort and convenience to the
subject [25,26,30,31].

In terms of speciﬁc sensing techniques, strain sensors have been fabricated on stretch-
able fabrics woven with ﬁne yarns [80], while pressure sensors have utilized knitted
cotton/spandex fabric [67]. Additionally, textile-based sensors have been developed for
monitoring respiration through capacitive sensing [66]. Textile-based capacitive sensors can
be fabricated using screen-printed silver ink electrodes on non-stretchable nonwoven tex-
tiles, providing good ﬂexibility and robustness [71]. Moreover, fabric-based electrodes [108]
and metamaterial textiles [44] have been employed to facilitate wearable sensing, and
other textile substrates such as nonwoven fabrics [70] and knitted fabrics [76] have been

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

18 of 28

explored for cardio-respiratory monitoring. The utilization of fabrics and textile substrates
demonstrates the versatility and potential of integrating sensors and antennas into wear-
able technologies, enabling the development of comfortable, functional, and personalized
smart textiles.

4.1.3. Composite Materials

A variety of composite materials employing different types of materials have been
investigated for their applicability in respiration sensors. Thin ﬁlms of Si/SiO2 multilayer
composite can serve as the substrate for piezoelectric respiration sensors [34,97]. In another
study, co-doped barium titanate was used as the dielectric material for a capacitive respira-
tion sensor, allowing for both miniaturization and ﬂexibility [63]. Furthermore, hydrogel
composites that are soft and stretchable materials have been employed for monitoring vital
signs [74,75,120]. A zinc-based hydrogel was employed as the dielectric material for the
development of a supercapacitor for self-powered sensors in [72]. In addition, a composite
material consisting of sodium alginate, polyacrylamide, and gallium was employed for
a strain-sensitive hydrogel that could be used in wearable electronic devices [81].

The mechanical and biocompatibility characteristics of commonly used substrate

materials are summarized in Table 1.

4.1.4. Paper-Based Materials

Paper-based (PB) sensors have been widely reported for respiratory detection owing
to their excellent biocompatibility, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendly nature. The primary
material used in paper-based sensors is cellulose, which is a naturally occurring biopolymer.
For this reason, PB sensors generally exhibit good biocompatibility. Furthermore, their
lightweight and ﬂexibility ensure ease of use for continuous monitoring without causing
signiﬁcant inconvenience to the wearer. PB sensors are very cost-effective, as the primary
raw material is abundant and inexpensive and the manufacturing processes are not highly
specialized. This cost-effectiveness makes them easily accessible for a wide range of
healthcare applications. Another important feature is that paper sensors are biodegradable,
meaning that they can naturally break down over time without leaving behind harmful
residues. Therefore, environmentally friendly and disposable sensors can be fabricated
with paper-based materials at a very fractional cost.

In addition, the PB sensors can be easily customized and adapted to various respiratory
parameters, including humidity and pressure. For instance, a noninvasive wearable screen-
printed sensor was proposed in [62] for human respiration monitoring using humidity
sensing technique. The proposed sensor utilizes multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

19 of 28

and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites on a paper substrate. During inhalation and
exhalation, the hygroscopic nature of paper causes a change in the dielectric constant, which
in turn changes the capacitance of the sensor. Moreover, a low-cost approach was proposed
to fabricate a ﬂexible PB capacitive pressure sensor using common materials in [10], where
80 g/m2 printing paper was used as the dielectric material and polyester conductive tape
as ﬂexible electrodes. Likewise, a paper-based self-inductive folding displacement sensor
(PSIFS) that used common paper material and copper tape was proposed for monitoring
human respiration in [96].

4.2. Sensing Materials

Wearable sensors rely on various materials to enable their sensing capabilities and
enhance their overall performance. These materials are carefully chosen based on their
speciﬁc properties and the requirements of the sensor design. The conductivity of surfaces
plays a critical role in the operation of various respiration sensors, such as resistive, ca-
pacitive, inductive, and antenna-based sensors, as these sensors depend on the surface’s
conductivity to facilitate precise detection and measurements.

4.2.1. Metallic Materials

Metallic materials are used in sensors due to their excellent electrical conductivity,
which enables efﬁcient signal transmission and sensing capabilities. For instance, a high-
frequency litz wire was integrated into a textile shirt to make a coil for magnetic induction
sensor in [94]. Furthermore, the utilization of an ultrathin metal ﬁlm on a textured metallic
disk can enable the detection of multipolar spoof localized surface plasmons for breathing
monitoring [46]. Another approach involves a fully embroidered meander dipole antenna-
based sensor integrated into a T-shirt, where the conductive part of the antenna sensor
is composed of a silver-coated nylon thread [24]. Similarly, a wearable strain sensor for
biomedical monitoring was developed in [28] employing a conductive layout knitted with
highly conductive silver-coated yarns, resulting in a ﬂexible and conductive fabric. Lastly,
wearable sensors for non-contact monitoring of respiratory and heartbeat movements
can employ conductive textiles as the active sensing material [48]. The sensor in this
paper consisted of two layers of conductive textiles on a cloth substrate, with the top layer
patterned as a disk-like resonator and the bottom layer acting as a ground plane.

In addition, conductive inks and paints have emerged as effective materials for the
printing of sensors in the ﬁeld of wearable technology. These offer numerous advantages,
including ﬂexibility, low-cost fabrication, and compatibility with various substrates. Sil-
ver conductive ink has been used to create sensing areas on nonwoven fabrics, enabling
seamless integration into everyday clothing for textile-based respiration sensors [70,71].
Moreover, composite inks composed of elastomers, carbon particles, and PDMS microbeads
have been used for printable textile-based strain and humidity sensors, offering conduc-
tivity as well as ﬂexibility [80,83]. In [36], a temperature sensor for a smart bandage was
fabricated by forming electrodes with conductive silver paint on a ﬂexible PVC substrate.
Thus, metallic materials play an indispensable role in the sensor systems by either con-
tributing to sensing mechanisms or providing interconnects.

4.2.2. Carbon-Based Materials

Various types of carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene, and MXene,
have been used to fabricate wearable sensors for respiration sensors. Carbon nanotubes are
cylindrical structures made of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice with diameters
on the scale of a nanometer, and are classiﬁed into two main types: single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). To address the
need for cost-effective and non-invasive respiratory monitoring, researchers have explored
the use of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
composites [58,100,101]. These materials are utilized in the development of low-cost and
reliable wearable sensors for human respiration monitoring. The integration of MWCNTs

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

20 of 28

and PDMS in paper-based sensors offers an alternative solution to existing systems that re-
quire direct contact with the body and expensive monitoring equipment [62]. Furthermore,
a biocompatible and lightweight respiration sensor consisting of highly oriented carbon
nanotube (HO-CNT) ﬁlms embedded between polyacrylonitrile (PAN) layers with excellent
ﬂexibility and robustness was presented in [121]. Moreover, a combination of lignin-based
polyurethane foam and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been used to
provide conductivity and large surface area [91]. Additionally, MWCNTs have found
application in self-powered wireless humidity sensors, showcasing an extensive range of
humidity detection capabilities [122] and potential applications in respiration sensing.

Another popular carbon-based material is graphene, which is a single layer of carbon
atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. It is employed in breathing
analysis due to remarkable properties such as biocompatibility, low cost, and ease of
functionalization [34]. In addition, MXene, which is a conductive and hydrophilic material
belonging to a class of two-dimensional inorganic compounds, has been used for respiration
sensing. MXene has been integrated into a melamine sponge (MS) structure to create a 3D
bifunctional ﬂexible sensor [82]. This MXene-based sensor exhibited excellent response to
pressure and humidity, making it a versatile choice for respiration sensing applications. To
achieve mechanical robustness and high operational stability under dry and wet conditions,
researchers have employed composite inks composed of polyurethane elastomer, carbon
black nanoparticles, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HTs), and PDMS microbeads [80].
These ﬂexible textile strain sensors offer promising capabilities for integration into wearable
applications for breath monitoring.

The electrical and mechanical characteristics of commonly used sensing materials are

4.2.3. Conductive Polymers

Conductive polymers have emerged as promising materials for sensor applications
due to their unique combination of electrical conductivity, mechanical ﬂexibility, and
tunable properties. For instance, a combination of polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate (PEVA)
polymer and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been utilized for antenna
fabrication [25] for respiratory strain sensing. Multi-material ﬁbers are another approach
for developing respiration sensors. These ﬁbers combine different materials to achieve
enhanced performance and functionality in sensing applications. For respiration sensors,
polyimide-coated hollow-core silica glass capillaries with a silver layer have been utilized
as multi-material ﬁbers [26,31], providing both the mechanical ﬂexibility of polymers and
the conductive properties of silver. In another study, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) polymer, which is a transparent conductive polymer
with high ductility, was proposed for the design of a ﬂexible strain sensor [36]. Such
conductive polymers can be integrated into antenna designs and other sensing applications
to enable accurate respiration monitoring.

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

4.2.4. Piezoelectric Materials

Various piezoelectric materials have been employed in sensing due to their ability to
generate electrical signals in response to mechanical pressure or strain. Materials such as
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) ﬁlm and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ﬁlm have been used
as sensing materials in respiration sensors. PVDF ﬁlms can be utilized in nasal sensors for
non-invasive respiratory monitoring [104], and have been employed as the piezoelectric
material in self-powered active sensors for respiration monitoring [102]. A piezoelectric
PZT thin ﬁlm was utilized in a multifunctional wearable device that monitors motion
and respiratory frequency in [97]. The development of ﬂexible hybrid nanogenerators
has included the incorporation of materials such as ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP),
nanocomposite of barium titanate (BaTiO3), and MWCNTs, enabling energy harvesting
in the context of healthcare monitoring [100]. In [101], a battery-free electronic skin was
proposed that combines PDMS and MWCNTs-doped PVDF for multi-modal sensing. PVDF
has been extensively utilized in self-powering smart textile-based harvesters and sensors
for the purpose of respiratory monitoring [103].

4.2.5. Optical Fibers

Optical fibers are thin, flexible, and transparent strands made from high-quality glass or
plastic materials that can transmit light signals over long distances with minimal loss. They
have been extensively utilized in Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors used for strain sensing.
These sensors are based on the principle of periodic variation in refractive index along
an optical fiber, and offer unique advantages such as compatibility with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and immunity to electromagnetic interference [54]. Small and lightweight
FBG sensors enable integration into wearable systems such as elastic belts, ensuring comfort
and flexibility for users [56]. Usually, FBG sensors need to be encapsulated into flexible
materials such as silicone rubber to enhance their practicality and usability in wearable
devices intended for respiratory rate and heart rate monitoring applications [53,57].

4.3. Fabrication Techniques

Several existing fabrication techniques have been utilized to design functional and
reliable sensors for a range of wearable applications. This subsection summarizes common
fabrication techniques employed for wearable sensors, focusing on their application in
breath monitoring.

4.3.1. Printing

Various printing techniques, including screen printing, inkjet printing, and 3D printing,
are employed in the fabrication of wearable sensors, as shown in Figure 9a. Screen printing
is a frequently used technique in the fabrication of wearable sensors.
It involves the
deposition of conductive inks onto substrates through a mesh screen. This technique
enables the creation of sensor electrodes, interconnections, and routing with high precision
and repeatability. The use of conductive inks based on silver or carbon ensures good
electrical conductivity while maintaining ﬂexibility. Screen printing has been applied in
the fabrication of capacitive sensors for respiration monitoring, where the ink is selectively
deposited to create electrode patterns on the sensor substrate [62,63]. Moreover, screen
printing is equally feasible for non-woven textiles and substrates, as demonstrated in [70,71].
Similarly, textile strain sensors can be fabricated using the screen printing process, in which
the composite ink is printed onto a stretchable fabric to create the sensor [80]. This technique
offers the advantage of scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for large-scale
production of wearable sensors.

Other printing techniques, such as inkjet printing and 3D printing, are employed in
wearable sensor fabrication. Inkjet printing allows for the precise deposition of functional
materials such as conductive inks or graphene oxide solutions onto substrates to create
sensors with high resolution and customization capabilities. The droplet-based nature
of inkjet printing enables the creation of intricate sensor designs and the integration of

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

22 of 28

multiple sensing elements on a single substrate. This technique has been utilized in articles
where conductive inkjet printing is employed to fabricate wearable sensors [40,41]. On
the other hand, 3D printing enables the fabrication of complex sensor structures and
the integration of different materials. Using layer-by-layer deposition of materials, 3D
printing allows for the creation of sensor components with varying mechanical properties
and functionalities. This technique has been utilized for the fabrication of various parts
of respiration wearable sensors [57,78]. Altogether, these printing techniques offer high
resolution and design freedom, enabling the development of customized wearable sensors
with unique geometries and functionalities.

Figure 9. Fabrication techniques used for respiratory sensors: (a) printing [123]; (b) knitting [124];
(c) embroidery [125].

4.3.2. Knitting

Knitting and weaving techniques are employed in the fabrication of wearable sensors
using conductive fibers or yarns. These techniques allow for the integration of conductive el-
ements directly into the textile substrate, enabling seamless and flexible sensors. Conductive
fibers or yarns such as metal-coated fibers or carbon nanotube yarns are incorporated during
the knitting or weaving process to create conductive paths within the textile structure, as
depicted in Figure 9b. For instance, a wearable antenna was fabricated using conductive
yarns and knitting techniques in [28], with good conductivity ensured by a 99% pure silver-
plated nylon yarn with tightly knitted loops. Similarly, a wearable system that integrated
fabric sensors, electrodes, and connections all made using knitting techniques was proposed
for remote health monitoring in [110]. In [67], the fabrication of a multifunctional e-textile
incorporating polypyrrole on a knitted cotton/spandex fabric was proposed.

Additionally, CNC knitting machines are employed to seamlessly produce and in-
tegrate various components in a single knitting process, including sensors, antennas,
conductive fabrics, nonconductive fabrics, and in one case a PCB pockets for a battery-
less wearable compression sensor [16]. Moreover, circular knitting machines are used to
design fabric electrodes for respiratory monitoring, enabling accurate measurements of
resistance under different conditions [108]. In [76], a combination of knitting technology
and coating printing industrial processes was utilized to fabricate knitted and printed
sensors for a wearable monitoring system. The knitting and weaving approaches offer the
advantage of simultaneous sensor fabrication and textile production, eliminating the need
for additional assembly steps.

Sensors 2023, 23, 7518

4.3.3. Embroidery

Embroidery has been utilized in the fabrication of wearable sensors for various appli-
cations, including real-time breath monitoring. In this technique, conductive threads or
yarns are embroidered onto the textile substrate to create sensor electrodes and connectors.
The electrical conductivity of the threads can be optimized for desired sensor performance
by carefully controlling the stitching pattern and density. For instance, an embroidered
antenna-based sensor is proposed for real-time breathing monitoring using a commercial
two-ply conductive yarn [30]. The layout of the embroidered meander dipole antenna
sensor was converted into a digital stitch pattern and embroidered on a commercially
available t-shirt using an embroidery machine, as illustrated in Figure 9c. This system
successfully demonstrated real-time wireless monitoring of breathing patterns.

Similarly, a textile-based embroidered passive strain and displacement sensor was de-
veloped using standard embroidery processes and commercially available conductive yarns
in [33]. Lastly, a wearable sensor for detecting respiration was created by embroidering
conductive thread onto the fabric to form the electrodes and the connection terminals and
circuit in [66]. The integration of conductive elements through embroidery allows for com-
fortable and unobtrusive sensor placement on clothing or other wearable garments. This
technique offers several advantages, including the ability to create ﬂexible and stretchable
sensors that can conform to the shape of the human body.

5. Conclusions and Perspectives

This review has shown that low-frequency and high-frequency sensors can both be
effectively utilized in respiration sensing, each offering unique advantages while facing
specific challenges. Low-frequency sensors provide direct measurements of respiratory
movements with simple designs and wide frequency response. However, challenges exist in
terms of hysteresis, electrode-to-skin contact, motion artifacts, and environmental interference.
On the other hand, high-frequency sensors offer wireless and contactless operation with
good communication capabilities, while challenges arise in terms of power consumption,
data transmission, and complexity of design. Furthermore, it is apparent that a highly
diverse range of materials can be employed in the design of respiration sensors, ranging from
polymers and textiles to metals and carbon-based substances. Obviously, these materials all
possess their respective advantages and limitations in the context of specific applications.
Therefore, key considerations should include materials with key properties such as flexibility
and biocompatibility that can ensure long-term operation without causing discomfort to
the user. Moreover, commonly used fabrication techniques such as printing, knitting, and
embroidery have been discussed and assessed based on factors such as the design resolution
of the sensor, manufacturing cost, and suitability for large-scale production.

In the context of future research, promising potential exists for self-powered wearable
respiration sensors specifically designed for low-frequency applications. These sensors utilize
piezoelectric and triboelectric components to create self-sustaining systems. However, chal-
lenges persist in miniaturization and efficiently when converting mechanical breathing energy
into electrical power while ensuring user comfort. High-frequency sensors have emerged as
a promising trend in the field of respiration sensors due to their ability to simultaneously sense
and communicate breathing information in a compact form factor. In this context, antenna
sensors and RFID sensors have shown promise as viable candidates for this purpose. Addi-
tional research could focus on enhancing the design of wearable antenna sensors to minimize
radiation exposure to users. Furthermore, exploring chipless RFID sensors as an alternative to
chip-based RFID could facilitate larger-scale production and ensure long-term operation. The
integration of metamaterials into existing sensors holds great promise, offering advantages
such as tunability and enhanced sensing capabilities. Additionally, as flexible metamaterials
are very versatile on their own, they could be used for sensing, shielding, and energy harvest-
ing in smart textiles. Opportunities for further research can be found in the optimization of
metamaterial design and fabrication techniques that can enable their seamless integration into
wearable devices for diverse sensing applications, including respiration monitoring.

Abstract: Continuous respiration monitoring is an important tool in assessing the patient’s health and
diagnosing pulmonary, cardiovascular, and sleep-related breathing disorders. Various techniques and
devices, both contact and contactless, can be used to monitor respiration. Each of these techniques
can provide different types of information with varying accuracy. Thermal cameras have become a
focal point in research due to their contactless nature, affordability, and the type of data they provide,
i.e., information on respiration motion and respiration flow. Several studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of this technology and developed robust algorithms to extract important information from
thermal camera videos. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in respiration monitoring
using thermal cameras, dividing the system into acquiring data, defining and tracking the region of
interest, and extracting the breathing signal and respiration rate. The approaches taken to address
the various challenges, the limitations of these methods, and possible applications are discussed.

1. Introduction

Monitoring respiration has a fundamental role in healthcare, providing valuable in-
sights into an individual’s physiological state. Respiratory rate, volume, and pattern can be
crucial indicators of the person’s health status, early warning signs, and potential diagnosis
of underlying medical conditions. For example, monitoring respiration is essential in criti-
cal care settings, where changes in breathing patterns may signal impending respiratory
distress or failure. Another example is in distress situations of patients suffering from
chronic diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, where
continuous respiratory monitoring helps in the management of the diseases, allowing
timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, premature babies in the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require continuous monitoring of respiration to prevent
scenarios of hypoxia or apnea of prematurity [1]. Furthermore, in the case of diagnos-
ing breathing-related sleep disorders, monitoring respiration during sleep is essential to
establish a diagnosis and evaluate the treatment process [2–5].

There are different techniques to continuously monitor respiration that vary in their
invasiveness, precision, applicability to different clinical situations, and cost of implemen-
tation. The choice of monitoring method and the gold standard methods depend on the
specific needs of the patient, the clinical setting, and the information required by healthcare
providers. Furthermore, when talking about respiration monitoring, various quantities
could be measured here. This includes respiration rate (number of breaths per minute) as
well as other quantities describing the respiratory quality, like respiratory effort, volume
of air inhaled or exhaled, percentage of gases or saturated hemoglobin in the blood, CO2
saturation during exhalation, and lung volumes and capacities [5].

The method considered as the gold standard to monitor respiration continuously is the
end-tidal CO2 technique. The end-tidal CO2 technique (EtCO2) is performed through en-
dotracheal intubation or through capnography where it measures the partial pressure of
exhaled CO2 [6]. As the technique might be rather obtrusive for continuously monitoring
respiration, it is primarily used to monitor patients when endotracheal intubation takes
place [7].

A frequently used method for the evaluation of respiration quality in clinical practice
is the use of pulse oximetry. This technique uses LEDs and photodiodes to measure the
peripheral saturation of oxygen (SpO2) by analyzing the light absorption ratio between the
hemoglobin’s wavelength and deoxyhemoglobin’s wavelength [8–10]. This technique is
often used to estimate other quantities (e.g., heart rate) and derived quantities (respiration
rate) as well. The devices for pulse oximetry require skin contact with fingers, forehead,
nose, foot, ears, or toes, and measurements can be affected by skin pigmentation, obesity,
and hypotension [11]. These methods are contact-based methods that may restrict the
patient’s movement, cause discomfort and skin irritation, and disturb the patient. For this
reason, non-contact alternatives have been a topic of research since the late 1990s [12,13].
Most non-contact methods measure respiration rate either through the analysis of
flow variations and/or the analysis of motion variation. Figure 1 shows how the different
non-contact methods fit in this division. The respiration flow consists of the air that is
inhaled and exhaled in each respiration cycle, whereas the respiration motion refers to the
movement in the chest area during this cycle.

Figure 1. Non-contact respiration monitoring techniques divided into the respiration rate obtained
through flow data and respiration rate obtained through motion data.

Acoustic sensors can be used to monitor respiration rate without direct contact, taking
advantage of the breath-related acoustic signals caused by exhaled air turbulence. In [14], a
speaker is used to transmit ultrasonic frequencies and microphones are used to detect re-
flections. In [15], the respiration rate is measured using a smartphone’s microphone placed
2 cm from the mouth/nose area. Nevertheless, these systems are extremely vulnerable to
environmental noise, wind or airflow, patient movements, and microphone placement.

A promising technique to monitor respiration rate without contact is by measuring
the CO2 concentration. This can be done either through a sensor placed between 20 and
60 cm from the mouth and nose [16] or through the use of thermal cameras operating in
the CO2 absorption band [17]. Both approaches are currently in the development stage, but
their practical use is conditioned by the considerable expense associated with the sensors,
making them less attractive for clinical applications.

The second category in Figure 1 monitors respiration rate through motion. For example,
respiration is measured through the use of radar technology. Radar detects respiration by
analyzing reflected signals to estimate or evaluate chest movements during breathing [18,19].
Different radar types, like continuous-wave, frequency-modulated continuous wave, ultra-

Sensors 2024, 24, 8118

wideband, and Doppler radar, can be employed, and ongoing research aims to improve accuracy
for non-invasive respiration monitoring [20].

Optical methods offer another option to quantify body movements caused by respira-
tion, in a contactless manner. These methods, which are under development, include the
use of video photoplethysmography [21,22] as well as fiber-grating vision sensors. These
sensors change their characteristic wavelength response when exposed to external stimuli
such as strain or temperature [23]. However, the downsides of these methods include
their accuracy dependence on environment lighting and temperature conditions, as well as
significant implementation costs [12,21].

Another method to monitor respiration consists of the use of magnetic impedance. This
involves generating a magnetic field using coils and then measuring the resulting impedance
changes that occur due to the movement of air in and out of the lungs. The sensors used for
this technology can be placed in a bed’s mattress or a chair’s backrest [24–26], making this a
promising way to monitor respiration unobtrusively.

An alternative variation of the optical methods is remote oximetry, which operates on the
same principle as contact-based pulse oximetry. This technology compares light absorption
at two wavelengths that correlate with the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated
hemoglobin. Variations in light absorption at these wavelengths generate a photoplethysmog-
raphy (PPG) signal, which can be used to derive the respiration signal and respiration rate.
Additionally, the ratio of these signals enables the calculation of SpO2 values [27,28].

The wavelengths used are usually within the visible and the near-infrared (NIR)
spectrum, but recent studies have been trying to use remote oximetry using two different
channels of RGB cameras [29–31]. Nevertheless, despite being still in development, this
method is very sensitive to illumination (whether visible or NIR) and can even require an
illumination source, restricting its application [30].

Finally, respiration can also be continuously monitored considering the variations
of temperature between the inhaled and exhaled air. Thermal sensors, such as thermal
cameras, measure the infrared radiation and correlate it to the absolute or relative tempera-
ture. This allows the measurement of temperature variations that can be associated with
respiration movements, through the contrast between the body and the background condi-
tions or clothing, or respiration flow through the differences of temperatures in the nostrils
and mouth area [5]. Therefore, thermal cameras appear in an advantageous position since
they use both the respiration flow data and the respiration motion data. This characteristic
of thermography for respiration monitoring is particularly interesting for applications
where the distinction between respiration motion and flow is important, for instance, in
the distinction between different types of sleep apneas. In addition, this technology is
not affected by lighting conditions or by the environmental temperature, within limits,
unveiling its potential, especially for monitoring respiration during sleep.

The ultimate goal when monitoring respiration is to have a method that offers the
advantages of both continuous and remote monitoring, enabling healthcare providers to
accurately track respiratory parameters over extended periods, both in clinical settings
and at home. Taking into account all of this, thermal cameras appear as a highly promis-
ing method. This work describes the steps and techniques applied for respiration rate
monitoring with thermal cameras for clinical purposes. Considering that this is a field
under development without large clinical trials or standard protocols, this overview sum-
marizes the most relevant studies done up to this moment and gives insights into different
applications and limitations. The focus of this overview is limited to studies that use
thermal cameras alone instead of hybrid models so that the different challenges within
each processing step can be properly understood and addressed.

2. Remote Thermography

Thermal cameras measure infrared radiation and correlate it to the absolute or relative
temperature. The system for respiration rate (RR) estimation with thermal cameras can be
divided into different stages, as shown in Figure 2. The initial step comprises the process

Sensors 2024, 24, 8118

of acquiring thermal image sequences, i.e., videos, with one or multiple thermal cameras.
These can have different placements and can be facing the subject from different angles. In
some cases, the thermal cameras may be used in parallel with other cameras, for instance,
RGB cameras [32–34] or NIR cameras [35]. Depending on the cameras’ specifications and
placement, the field of view may incorporate non-relevant elements and noise inducers to
the breathing signal. Therefore, it is necessary to define a region of interest (ROI) where the
pixels with potential breathing information are present. The approach used for monitoring
can imply the need for an ROI tracking mechanism throughout the acquisition period. By
evaluating the pixels’ intensity variation over time, within the ROI, the breathing signal can
be estimated. This signal requires some filtering for noise reduction and pattern enhancement.
The RR is calculated as the frequency of the breathing signal.

Figure 2. Pipeline for respiration rate monitoring and apnea detection in acquisitions with thermal
cameras. Each step in the pipeline is described in the section indicated in parentheses.

The general pipeline described above can be approached in several ways. Different
studies have been done in order to find the best methods that value simplicity and/or
accuracy. Tables 1–3 comprise different studies done, values measured, the used datasets,
reference methods, as well as techniques used. The following sections describe how each
study, chronologically organized, developed each of the pipeline’s steps.

2.1. Data Acquisition

Thermal cameras used for respiration rate monitoring are available in different price
ranges, resolution ranges, and different specifications. Thermal cameras can measure either
medium-wave infrared (MWIR) or long-wave infrared (LWIR) signals. MWIR cameras
usually have a greater resolution than LWIR cameras. High-resolution cameras are costly
and have as high as 1280 × 1024 pixels and reach frame rates of 30 Hz. As a low-cost
alternative, low-resolution thermal cameras usually have resolutions of 160 × 120 pixels
but can go as low as 60 × 80, and their frame rate is usually around 10 Hz. Low-resolution
cameras pose a challenge regarding the proximity of the subject or the need for optical
lenses to provide reliable measurements. There are also high-speed thermal cameras with
frame rates above 100 Hz and with a resolution of around 512 × 640 pixels. However, for
respiration monitoring, which consists of signals around 0.2 Hz, an increase in temporal
resolution is not needed. So far, no researchers used cameras with these properties for
respiration monitoring. For respiration monitoring, the thermal cameras used have a sensi-
tivity between 0.025 ◦C and 0.070 ◦C. To convert a pixel intensity into a temperature value,
there needs to be a calibration by setting an emissivity value or by using a reference object
with known emissivity. However, in this application, the goal is to monitor temperature
changes; therefore, only temperature differences are used. This is particularly important
since, this way, there is no need to calibrate the thermal sensors and no need to set a value
of emissivity. However, any disturbances during the recordings might affect the emissivity
and therefore create momentarily inaccuracies.

Since 2000, Pavlidis and his group started applying the use of remote thermography
to monitor vital signs [36–38]. In 2006, they began applying this technology to the measure
of respiration. Murthy and Pavlidis et al. experimented with MWIR cameras (Phoenix
camera [39] and FLIR SC-6000 [40]), both with 640 × 512 pixels. In this first study, the
average breathing rate of three healthy participants was estimated. The camera was placed
sideways to the patient at around 2 m distance at a specific viewing. As a reference

Sensors 2024, 24, 8118

5 of 23

method, a respiration belt sensor was used [39]. The average accuracy for this method was
around 96%; nevertheless, the sample size was not significant and the conditions of the
recording, specifically the camera placement and viewing angle, were very restrictive. In
their follow-up study [40], the goal was to detect airflow abnormalities. For this, 14 healthy
participants and 13 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were recruited, and the
measurement results were compared with the simultaneously collected polysomnography
(PSG). They achieved a chance-corrected agreement (kappa) of 0.92 with the thermistor
signal, 0.83 with the nasal pressure signal, and 0.80 with the expired CO2. Even though
this was the first study that demonstrated feasibility in detecting airflow abnormalities
with thermal imaging, the sample size is still low, the ground truth scoring was limited to
apneas (pause in breathing) and hypopneas (shallow breathing or low breathing rate), and
the classification was done manually.

Also in 2009, Fei and Pavlidis [41] used, as well, the FLIR SC-6000 MWIR camera
with an indium antimonide (InSb) detector to measure the breathing rate of 20 healthy
participants and compared the results with waveforms extracted from thermistors. The
complement of the absolute normalized difference (CAND) obtained was 98.27%. However,
the measurements were solely based on the nostrils, and the patients were asked to stay
very still, which did not represent a daily life clinical setting.

In 2010, Al-Khalidi et al. [42] focused their study on detecting and tracking the region
of interest (ROI) for respiration rate monitoring using the FLIR A40 thermal camera at
50 fps. The maximum failure rate obtained was 8%, presenting a reliable starting point for
breathing monitoring.

Abbas et al. [43], in 2011, used the VarioCAM®, an LWIR camera, for the first time,
measure the breathing rate of seven infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Although it had a relatively small population size, this study showed the potential of
neonatal monitoring with thermal cameras.

Lewis et al. [44] performed a study comparing two different thermal cameras when
estimating the breathing rate and the relative tidal volume. The cameras used were the
TVS-700 with twelve patients and the FLIR SC-6000 with seven patients. The ground
truth was established through the LifeShirt® system (Vivometrics, Inc., Ventura, CA, USA).
For the TVS-700 camera, the mean correlation obtained for the breath interval was 0.98
and for the relative tidal volume was 0.90. For the SC-6000 camera, the mean correlation
obtained for the breath interval was 0.95 and for the relative tidal volume was also 0.90.
This study presented an interesting approach for tidal volume measurement; however, it
used a reduced sample size and a specific environment.

Also in 2011, Goldman et al. [45] tested on 17 children with respiratory pathologies to
measure respiration airflow and synchronicity of thoracoabdominal motion, since abnormal
breathing can be associated with asynchronous movements of the thorax and abdomen. They
used nasal pressure transducers and manual annotations as a reference. The results obtained
show a Cronbach’s Alpha value of 0.976 between the measured signals and the references. In
addition, they showed that the time delay observed between the ribcage and the abdomen in
children with respiratory disease was significantly different from that of healthy children.

Considering a different type of application, Chauvin et al. [46] measured the RR of
subjects biking on a stationary bike for telerehabilitation purposes. They tested 15 healthy
participants with different facial characteristics and in 4 different conditions, using a
respiration belt as a reference. The thermal camera was positioned in front of the bike in a
pan–tilt unit. Chauvin et al. showed that monitoring the RR becomes a challenge once the
subjects have glasses or facial hair. They obtained a wide range of tpi, the percentage of
cycles where the error is lower than 1 bpm, within the different conditions. This proves the
feasibility of using such technique in a high dynamic setting but highlights the different
challenges that come inherent to it.

In 2015, Pereira et al. started a series of studies with thermal cameras [48,51,53,54]. A
new algorithm to detect and track the ROI and estimate the breathing rate was presented.
The first study [48] included 11 healthy participants, and a piezo plethysmography (thoracic
effort) sensor was used as a reference. These studies laid an important background for
breathing signal processing and respiratory disorders detection. In addition, Pereira et al.
presented the first study that did not rely on the detection of facial landmarks to measure
the respiration signal [54].

Ruminski et al., between 2016 and 2017, developed new ways to measure RR from
thermal videos of healthy adults [49,50,52]. The main novelty of Ruminski’s approach
consisted of different estimators to extract the RR from the breathing signals. They achieved
an MAE between 0.415 and 1.291 bpm in [49,50] and between 0.236 and 0.350 bpm in [52].
In 2017, Cho et al. presented two studies where they used the FLIR ONE thermal
camera to measure the respiration rate in highly dynamic scenes [55] and to detect stress
situations based on changes in the breathing patterns [56]. These studies presented the
results of 23 and 8 healthy participants, respectively. In the first study, the correlation
found between the breathing rate acquired through thermal imaging and from the reference
respiration belt sensor was 0.99. The second study concluded that there was an accuracy of
84.59% in distinguishing between two levels of stress with thermal imaging.

In 2019, Hochhausen et al. implemented the algorithm developed by Pereira et al. [48]
in a real clinical setting [57]. For that, 28 patients were monitored in the post-anesthesia care
unit (PACU) with a thermal camera positioned at the foot of the bed. The results showed a
Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient of 0.607 on arrival to the PACU and 0.849 upon discharge.
Lower respiration rates represented higher correlation values (RR < 12 breaths/min, R = 0.845),
whereas higher respiration rates resulted in lower correlation values (RR > 15 breaths/min,
R = 0.458), showing the need for improvement of the algorithm.

Chan et al. [58], also in 2019, recruited 27 adults admitted to the intensive care unit
(ICU) to monitor their respiration rate with a thermal camera placed at two different
distances (0.4–0.6 m and > 1 m). As a reference, chest impedance through ECG electrodes
and manual annotations from qualified observers were used. However, these two methods
had a limited Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.683. A combination of these two methods
was used as the ground truth. The study, which also used Pereira et al.’s algorithm [48],
obtained a Person correlation coefficient of 0.960 for the closest distance and 0.508 for the
furthest distance. Nevertheless, considering the proximity of the camera to the participants,
the first setup is not feasible in a normal clinical setting.

Between 2020 and 2022, Jagadev et al. [60,61] used machine learning approaches to
monitor the respiration rate with the FLIR A325 infrared camera placed at a distance of 1 m
from the participants. The first algorithm developed reached a precision of 98.76% and a
sensitivity of 99.07% while the second study obtained accuracies between 98.8 and 99.5%,
bringing a new perspective into the way of filtering the collected signals.

Jakkaew et al. [59] used a portable thermal camera (Seek Thermal Compact PRO for an
Apple iPhone) attached to a phone to measure the RR. The camera was placed at 1 m from
the side of each of the 16 participants and the reference data were collected from the Go
Direct respiratory belt. The study obtained a root mean square error of 1.82 breaths/min
and, just like Pereira et al. [54], presented an interesting method to monitor the respiration
rate without detecting facial landmarks.

Between 2020 and 2021, Lorato et al. published a series of studies in which they tried
to assess respiration rate and to detect apnea events in premature newborns [62,63,68]. A
setup with three FLIR Lepton cameras positioned on the side (facing the baby’s face) and
at the foot side of the bed was used. Just like Pereira et al. [54] and Jakkaew et al. [59],
no facial landmarks were detected. The reference measures were obtained using chest
impedance (CI). In [62], the respiration rate was obtained with a mean absolute error of
2.07 breaths/min. In [68], the thermal images were combined with RGB recordings to detect
and classify motion and define whether the RR can be extracted. The mean absolute error
(MAE) for recording segments with some motion present was 1.97 breaths/min and the

Sensors 2024, 24, 8118

9 of 23

overall MAE was 5.36 breaths/min (both from the validation set). It is important to note
that the respiration rate for newborns is between 30 to 60 breaths/min, whereas for adults
is 12 to 18 breaths/min. In [63], Lorato et al. developed a method to separate the respiration
flow from the respiration motion in thermal videos that obtained an accuracy of 84%. In
this same study, to prove the relevance of detecting respiration flow pixels, obstructive
apneas (OAs) were simulated and then detected. This revealed an improvement in the
detection method of OA.

Kwon et al. [64], in 2021, performed a study with a population of 101 adults in
the PACU. For each patient, a 2-min video was recorded with a thermal camera and, as
references, the RR obtained through chest impedance was used and the number of breaths
during one minute was also manually registered. The results showed a correlation between
the two reference methods of 0.65 and a correlation between the manual annotations and
the remote thermography of 0.95.

Lyra et al. [65] measured the respiration rate of 26 patients in the ICU using a thermal
camera mounted to the ceiling of the room. With deep learning algorithms to isolate the
chest and the head of the patients, they achieved an MAE of 2.69 bpm.

Also in 2021, Takahashi et al. [66] used the Boson320 camera to measure the respiration
rate of seven volunteers. Their method consists of using a deep learning approach to
segment the face of the subject and a respiratory likelihood index to find the respiration
signal. They achieved an MAE of 0.66 bpm.

In 2022, Shu et al. [67] did a lab study with eight healthy volunteers where thermal
videos were recorded while they followed an instructed protocol. In this protocol, the
volunteers were asked to simulate three different breathing speeds and to either keep their
heads still or to create some head movements. A wearable device was used as a reference.
Shu et al. managed to achieve an error lower than 2% on these recordings.

Based on the research of Lorato et al. [62] on respiration extraction, Alves et al. per-
formed some additional research on the number of cameras needed and camera positioning
for accurate assessment of respiration rate during sleep [69]. It was concluded that the
number of cameras and their placement do not influence the quality of results as long as
the subject’s face is visible. This study shows how practical and easy to implement thermal
cameras can be to facilitate the patients and the clinical staff.

2.2. Defining and Tracking the Region of Interest (ROI)

Defining the region of interest (ROI) is one of the most important steps while extracting
the breathing signal from thermal videos. This depends on the camera view or placement
used and can also affect the way the signal is processed.

The respiration can be detected in thermal videos in several places and, therefore, the
ROI can also have different locations. Most studies focus on the nostrils and surrounding
areas, as exhaled air is warmer than inhaled air, creating a detectable thermal contrast.
Nevertheless, some studies look for the thermal signature related to breathing movements
or even detect respiration flow outside of the subject’s body.

In their 2006 study [39], Murthy et al. used a lateral view of the participant and
selected the ROI as a square underneath the tip of the nose and between the nostrils and
the mouth. The selection of the initial position of the ROI is semi-automatic since the user
can adjust or select it. Subsequently, the tracking algorithm follows the ROI as long as
the user does not rotate his head or the source of airflow does not change. Later in their
work, in 2009 [40], Murthy et al. used a view of the subject’s face at the foot end of the
bed. From that view, the ROI is defined as a rectangle around the nostrils. The nostril can
be segmented from the rest of the image by detecting the colder boundaries (the cartilage
areas) through the application of a Sobel edge detector [70] on the original thermal images.
In this study, Murthy used the coalitional tracking system for the facial tissue based on
advanced statistics [71], and, for each frame, the ROI was computed. An example of a
thermal image acquired during this work with the computed ROI is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Recreation of a thermal image acquired by Murthy et al. in their 2009 study [40] and
respective ROI computed.

Fei and Pavlidis [41] used a coalitional tracking algorithm to track facial tissue during
recordings by analyzing the spatial distribution of the filter tracker’s clusters. The algo-
rithm follows a tracking ROI that comprises the nostril region where the measures are
therefore performed.

Al-Khalidi’s work [42], in 2010, focused on the detection and tracking of the optimal
ROI defined as the skin area centered on the tip of the nose. The method detects facial
features and uses them to define the ROI. Initially, the images are enhanced with a median
filter (size 5) and, subsequently, the face is segmented from the background. The ROI can be
computed using one of two methods. The first method entails that the tip of the nose is the
lowest intensity pixel in the central region of the face (coldest point in the face), whereas the
second method suggests that the tip of the nose is the lowest intensity pixel in between the
two regions with the highest intensity pixels, the eye corners. Both methods then construct
the ROI as a circle around the tip of the nose. This study considered that the second method
had a lower failure rate.

In their work in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [43], Abbas et al. selected the
ROI manually as the nostril region taking over the infant’s mouth. There was no automatic
ROI definition or tracking involved, therefore this method is only applicable when there is
little to no movement of the subject.

Lewis et al. [44] used the Piecewise Bézier Volume Deformation model (PBVD) in their
work, which a model that used smooth 3D manipulation to track, through control points,
the movement of specific facial features; in this case, the nostrils [72].

Goldman at al. [45] manually defined three ROIs located in the nose area, the thorax,
and the abdomen. Consecutive frames were subtracted to remove stationary pixels and
enhance the positive and negative variations of the breathing patterns.

Chauvin et al. [46] used a tracking, learning, and detection algorithm (TLD). After a
manual selection of the ROI, this algorithm is able to track the ROI and even detect if there
is a need for reinitialization. The tracking is based on the Lucas–Kanade algorithm [73] and
the learning is done using a semi-supervised approach. Finally, the position of the ROI is
used to adjust the camera position in the pan–tilt unit.

In their initial studies, Pereira et al. [48,51,53] used an automatic ROI detection for the
first frame that is tracked using the least-squares algorithm developed by Mei et al. [74]. To
detect the ROI, the face is initially segmented using a multi-level Otsu threshold [80] where
the background noise is removed and the remaining area is the subject’s face. Then, several
steps of thresholding, temperature projections, and edge detections are performed to allow the
visualization of periorbital regions (warmer regions) to detect the nostrils (in [48,53]) or the
mouth and the shoulders (in [51]). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a smaller region
inside the ROI was defined named the region of measurement (ROM), which is used to extract
the breathing signal. In the study in 2018, Pereira et al. [54] used a “black box” approach
where no features were extracted to define the ROI. In this study, a grid was laid over the
video and each grid cell was treated as an ROI to extract the respiration signal and RR.

Ruminski et al. defined the ROI manually as the nostrils/nose [49,50] or as the region
containing the nose and the mouth [52], ensuring that the ROI is big enough to account for
small movements of the subject.

Sensors 2024, 24, 8118

Cho et al. developed a nostril tracking algorithm that initially does an optimal quantifica-
tion as a pre-processing [55]. This way, there is a conversion between the absolute temperature
distributions to color-mapped images. The resulting output is then used to compute the
thermal gradient map where feature points can be detected and tracked by Lucas–Kanade’s
disparity-based tracker [73] and Kalal et al.’s median flow algorithm [75].

In the studies of Chan et al. [58] and Hochhausen et al. [57], the ROI was manually
selected and a tracking algorithm for the ROI was used. Chan and colleagues used the
Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi feature tracker [73,76] and Hochhausen implemented the algorithm
proposed by Mei et al. [74].

Jagadev et al., in 2020 [60], manually detected the nostrils’ region using the FLIR
software [81]. Then, to track the defined ROI over time, they used the algorithm proposed
by Kazemi et al. [77] that estimates the facial landmarks’ location using an optimization of
the sum of square error loss. The facial landmarks correspond to a set of points surrounding
the chin area, mouth, nose, eyes, and eyebrows. In 2022 [61], the team developed a deep
learning model to automate the face and nostrils detection—the Residual network 50 +
Facial landmark detection’ (ResNet50+FLD) model.

Jakkaew and colleagues did a pre-processing of the images by applying a Gaussian
filter in order to remove noises from the input [59]. Then, two different methods were
tested to compute the ROI. The first method considers the ROI as the square around the
highest intensity value, whereas the second method defines ROI as the largest area above a
certain threshold. The two methods were not compared but combined in the next step to
extract the respiration signal.

Following the same idea as Pereira et al.’s study [54], Lorato et al. presented an ap-
proach where the ROI detection did not rely on facial landmarks [62,68]. These approaches
become relevant since they are focused on the presence of a breathing signal and not on
facial features that might require specific camera angles or viewing perspectives. To do that,
Lorato et al. combined three different features to find a core pixel that is correlated to the
rest of the ROI. The features used are the pseudo-periodicity, which can be defined as the
predominant frequency of each pixel; the respiration rate clusters, which consist of a mea-
sure of similarity of one pixel with its neighboring pixels; and the thermal gradient, which
is a measure of thermal contrast. The normalized matrices for each feature are combined
into one matrix where the highest intensity pixel is considered the core pixel. The core pixel
becomes the pixel that is more likely to have a high-quality respiration signal. The ROI
contains all the pixels whose Pearson correlation value with the core pixel is higher than 0.7.
Figure 4 contains an example of the acquired thermal images, the matrix combining all
the features, and the ROI selected pixels. In their later study, in [63], Lorato et al. also
introduced two more features that were subsequently used to distinguish respiration flow
(RF) from respiration motion (RM). These features are the covariance map and the flow
map. The flow map is a combination of all the features that is used as an input to a Gabor
bank of filters, empirically defined, in order to enhance pixels where flow is most likely to
be present.

Kwon et al. [64] manually defined the ROI as a region around the nose, and, consider-
ing that each recording was 2 min, no tracking of the ROI was performed. Nevertheless,
data from six patients were priorly excluded due to excessive movement.

Also in 2021, Lyra et al. [65] implemented the YOLOv4-Tiny deep learning model [78]
to locate the head and chest of the patients. This model was trained using manually labeled
frames and was also able to identify any clinical staff within the field of view, enabling
real-time monitoring.

Similarly to Lyra et al., Takahashi et al. [66] used the YOLOv3 deep learning model [79]
to detect the face of the subject. The face region is then divided into several subregions where
a respiratory likelihood index is computed. This value, ranging between 0 and 1, is related to
the most respiratory-related areas, usually located around the nose and the mouth.

Also using the YOLOv3 deep learning model [79], Shu et al. [67] were able to create a
system that detects and tracks the nostrils. This model achieved accuracies of 97.9% with
both static and moving conditions.

Some other studies investigated further the choice of ROI and how it can be affected,
for instance, by medical devices. Huang et al. [82], in 2021, used a deep alignment network
to extract the mouth and nose area. They used this information to classify whether a person
was breathing through the nose or the mouth. In 2022, Koroteeva et al. [83] analyzed the
effect of the use of a face mask on the distribution of heat in the face and on the dispersion
of airflow. Telson et al. [84], in 2024, compared three different ROIs: a line, a rectangle, and
an ellipse, all in the mouth and nostrils area, simultaneously. They concluded that both the
rectangle and the ellipse ROI shapes significantly detect the temperature changes between
inhalation and exhalation.

The selection of the ROI is a fundamental step in monitoring respiration with thermal
cameras. Although most of the methods mentioned focus on the nose and nostrils area, the
ROI can also be located in other parts of the body or even, for instance, on the pillow due to
the heating waves of the breathing airflow. The robustness of the ROI detection will depend
on how controlled the conditions for measurement should be. Having a method that does
not require the detection of facial landmarks and is prepared to find the ROI in several
areas will ultimately be less prone to errors. Finally, a method that can distinguish ROIs
associated with respiration motion from respiration flow will provide more information
and, therefore, can be used in more applications.

2.3. Breathing Signal Extraction and Respiration Rate Estimation

Following the definition of the ROI is the extraction of the breathing signal that can be
used to estimate the respiration rate (RR). In this step, the respiration signal can also be
distinguished between respiration flow and respiration motion.

After characterizing the ROI, Murthy et al. [39], in 2006, performed a 3-step operation
in the acquired videos to enhance the visualization of the inspiration and expiration
phases. The core step of this operation consisted of generating the differential infrared
thermography where a breath mask was created from the pixels whose value increased
above a certain threshold. These pixels should contain the breathing information. The
temperature together with the ROI size information is used to train the model that labels
the pixels as expiratory or non-expiratory. This labeling occurs for different frames over
time, and the duration of the expiratory and non-expiratory cycles gives an estimation of
the breathing rate of the subject. In their later work, in 2009, [40], Murthy et al. collected the
breathing waveform by applying a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in the normalized
thermal signal of the ROI that is defined as the pixel mean intensity value over time. The
breathing signal is then considered the strongest component of the CWT.

BSCA—Breathing signal characterization algorithm; RR—Respiration rate; ROI—Region of interest; CWT—
Continuous wavelet transform; ROM—Region of measurement; IBI—Inter-breath interval; SQI—Signal quality
index; CNN—Convolutional neural network; IIR—Infinite impulse response; PSD—Power spectral density.

Fei and Pavlidis [41] also used a wavelet analysis to extract the breathing rate from the
ROI of the thermal videos. For that, the signals were resampled to 10 Hz and normalized
before applying a CWT. The center frequency of the mother wavelet, adjusted for down
sampling, is the final RR. Abbas et al. [43] also applied a CWT to the average intensity of
the pixels in the ROI. They used the Debauchies (Db) transformation to decompose the
signal since it provides better results for biomedical signals [87].

Using the manually selected ROI, Al-Khalidi [42] extracted the breathing signal as the
average pixel value of that region, filtered using a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies
between 0.05 and 1 Hz (3 to 60 breaths/min).

In their study, Lewis et al. [44] considered the breathing signal as the average of two
mean temperatures of each nostril. The breathing signal was then detrended and zero-
padded before applying the FFT. The spectral density distribution obtained was used to
determine which was the predominant frequency between 3 and 65 breaths/min, which
was considered to be the RR. Lewis also integrated the thermal time series, which generated
a linear time series related to the tidal volume.

Goldman et al. [45] obtained the breathing signal of each ROI by computing the
difference between the positive and negative areas defined in the previous step. The
signals were then phase corrected and filtered with a low pass Chebyshev filter. A Fourier
transform was applied to extract the RR as the spectral maximum peak.

Chauvin et al. [46], in 2014, used the Sobel operator to obtain an approximation of a
gradient used to mask the ROI. The breathing signal is then considered as the average pixel
intensity within the mask region. They apply a Hann window and a Fourier transform to
the signal and define the RR as the predominant frequency between 0.2 and 0.5 Hz (12 to
30 breaths/min).

Pereira et al., in 2015 [48,53], defined the breathing signal as the mean temperature
of the ROI over time. To extract the RR from that signal, C. Pereira filtered the signal
with a Butterworth band-pass filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.1 and 0.85 Hz (6 and 51
breaths/min) and then applied the algorithm of Brüser et al. [85,88]. This algorithm uses
three estimators that are then combined with a Bayesian fusion method. The three estimators
are the adaptive window autocorrelation that computes the correlation for different frames
in a window of frames, the adaptive window average magnitude difference function that
finds the absolute difference between samples in an adaptive window, and the maximum
amplitude pairs that can be defined as an indirect peak finder. The Bayesian fusion method
that combines these three estimators returns a value for the inter-beat interval. Chan et al. [58],
Hochhausen et al. [57], and Kwon et al. [64] used the same method in their work.

In 2018, Pereira et al. [54] estimated the RR using four ROIs: the nose area, the mouth
area, and the two shoulders. The breathing waveform of the nose and mouth ROIs was
defined as the mean pixel intensity, and the breathing waveform of the shoulder ROIs
was considered as their vertical movement. The signals were processed and the RR was
computed through the Fourier transform. For each ROI signal, the signal quality index
(SQI) was determined based on four features of the normalized power spectrum. The
signals from all ROIs were combined using three different approaches: the median of all
signals, the best SQI, and the Bayesian fusion.

In a later work [54], Pereira and colleagues used a different approach to extract the RR
from thermal videos. For that, they placed a grid over each frame and treated each grid cell
separately. For each grid cell, they applied a Hamming window and a Fourier transform
and then normalized the signal to its maximum value. Subsequently, they computed the
breathing signal by filtering the signal between 0.1 and 3 Hz (6 to 180 breaths/min) and the
SQI using the same method as their previous work. The grid cells with a SQI higher than
0.75 were selected as the final ROI and the RR was computed using three different fusion
techniques, similar to the ones previously used.

Ruminski et al., in [49], extracted the respiration waveform as the average intensity
level of the manually defined ROI. The signal was then normalized, filtered with a moving
average operation (window size of five frames), and filtered with a Butterworth high pass
filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz. To find the respiration rate, Ruminski used four
different estimators: eRR_sp considered the highest peak in the frequency spectrum, eRR_ac
based on the periodicity of the signal peaks, eRR_zc based on the number of zero crossings,
and eRR_pk that uses the information of the number of peaks. It was concluded that the
estimator eRR_ac was the one that delivered the best results when compared to the reference
method. Nevertheless, these estimators were not combined at any point during the study.

In their later study, Ruminski et al. [52] introduced the skewness operator to extract the
respiration waveform. Skewness measures the symmetry or lack of symmetry of data and
the inspiration patterns create changes in the skewness parameter. The RR was computed
using three parameters similar to the ones described in their previous study. Ruminski et al.
concluded that the skewness operator largely improved their last results.

Cho et al., in [55], used a thermal voxel-based method to define the respiration signal
by mapping the thermal units into three-dimensional space and computing the volume
changes. This enhances the quality of the signal. The RR was determined using a short-time
power spectral density. That consists in applying the Fourier transform to the short-time
autocorrelation function using a Gaussian window. The obtained signal is filtered between
0.1 and 0.85 Hz (6 to 51 breaths/min) and the RR is defined as the value that maximizes the
power spectral density.

Also in 2017, Cho et al. [56] used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify
different stress levels. As an input, they used two-dimensional spectrograms that were
computed by stacking the power spectral density vector (PSD) over time. The data were
augmented while preserving each label. The final CNN architecture consisted of two
convolutional layers, two pooling layers, and one fully connected layer.

In Jagadev’s work [60], the breathing waveform was collected from the ROI and filtered
using different types of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. To understand which filter
presented the best results, several parameters were computed, such as SNR, mean square
error, magnitude response, and group delay. Jagadev concluded that the Butterworth filter
showed the best performance. Subsequently, a breath detection algorithm was applied to
the filtered signal that iterates several steps to improve the detection of breathing cycles.
This algorithm takes into consideration the number of peaks and valleys of the signal as
well as the cycle duration of waveforms with an SNR above a certain threshold. In their
follow-up work [61], the team used a machine learning approach to automatically detect
the RR—the “breathing signal characterization algorithm (BSCA)”. In addition, two classifiers
were tested: the decision tree and the support vector machine; the last one had the best results.

Jakkaew et al. [59] also applied several filtering steps to the breathing signal collected
as the average pixel intensity within the ROI. These steps consisted of using a Butterworth
filter (0.05 to 1.5 Hz), followed by a Savitzky–Golay filter, and then a moving average filter.
The RR is then settled as the number of peaks in the signal per time unit.

In I. Lorato’s work [62,63], the breathing signal was also computed as the average
pixel intensity within the ROI. The signal was filtered with a Butterworth filter and the RR
was considered the predominant frequency in the frequency spectrum of the signal.

Lyra et al. implemented an optical flow algorithm [86], a computer vision technique, that
detects motion by tracking changes in pixel intensities. It measures the displacement of pixels
over time within the chest region that is associated with breathing movements. The algorithm
is able to compute the frequency of these motion patterns, i.e., the RR in real time.

In their study, Takahashi et al. [66] defined the respiratory likelihood index for each
subregion of the face as a measure of the most respiratory-related areas. For that, they com-
pute the temperature signal for each subregion as the average temperature over time. That
signal goes through a frequency analysis. The respiratory likelihood index is a weighted
score of the power spectral density at respiratory-related frequencies. The frequency with
the highest index is, therefore, the RR.

In 2024, Shu et al. [67] also defined the breathing waveform as the average pixel
intensity within the ROI. They compared two low-pass filter options: the Chebyshev and
the Butterworth, ending up opting for the last one. The RR value was computed as the
dominant frequency in the obtained signal.

3. Applications

Thermal cameras are suitable for continuous respiration monitoring due to their non-
contact nature. Their applications can go from clinical use, such as monitoring patients in
ICUs or neonatal units, to home care settings for managing chronic conditions like COPD.
Besides giving information on respiration rate, thermal cameras can be used to evaluate
changes in respiration flow or cessation of breathing. Apnea is defined as the complete
cessation of airflow for at least 10 s, whereas hypopnea is a partial reduction in airflow
or breathing with a significant decrease in oxygen levels. Considering this, detecting or
identifying apnea or cessation of breathing with thermographic cameras becomes an area
of interest. In addition, since thermal cameras do not require an illumination source, their
application can also be extended to sleep monitoring and apnea detection. Even though
this is still an area under development, several studies of the ones previously mentioned
worked towards these utilizations.

Apnea Detection

In the study of Pereira and colleagues [48], participants were asked to simulate differ-
ent breathing patterns such as eupnea (normal spontaneous breathing), tachypnea, apnea,
and deep breathing. The breathing frequency obtained with thermal imaging was com-
pared with the piezoplethysmography signal through a correlation. The results revealed
an average correlation of 0.974 between the two methods. In addition, Pereira concluded
that the disparity between the two methods occurred mainly during the transitions and the
error outside this area was very small. Nevertheless, there was no automatic classification
algorithm implemented.

In 2016, Ruminski [49] used four different estimators to compute the respiration rate.
They concluded that, if the values of the estimators are significantly different, there is a
high chance that there is a cessation of respiration airflow. In these cases, an apnea detector
should be used, but this was not implemented in their study.

P. Jagadev [60] also implemented a classifier in order to distinguish four different
classes: normal breathing, abnormal breathing, tachypnea, and bradypnea. It used a
10-fold cross-validation k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier for multi-class classification.
The data showed it to be well separated with minimal overlap and, therefore, proved this
approach to be accurate.

The most recent study that delivered some insights into apnea classification was the
work by Lorato et al. in 2021 [63] that used recordings from infants in the neonatal medium
care unit. Lorato classified the pixels in a thermal video into RF (respiration flow), RM
(respiration motion), or MR (mixed respiratory) pixels. This classification distinguishes
between obstructive apnea (OA) and central apnea (CA). In CA, there is little to no RM
or RF detected and it can be comparable to a breath hold event. In OA, there can be an
increase in the respiratory effort—RM [89,90]—but there is a reduction in the RF and,
in the case of infants, even a total absence. To distinguish the different types of pixels,
Lorato considered that the RM occurs in only one direction (up and down movement of the
chest/abdominal area), whereas the RF creates a thermal gradient that spreads around in
every direction. Since no apnea events from their dataset were detected, OA was simulated.
Lorato et. al replaced the manually annotated RF pixels with noise pixels. Using the
last two features mentioned in Section 2.2, the automatic identification of RF pixels and
consequently definition of the RF signal was possible. To detect OA, I. Lorato applied
a cessation of breath (COB) detection algorithm [91] to the RF signal that consists of the
comparison between short-term standard deviation and long-term standard deviations.
The final algorithm was able to detect OA with 94.35% accuracy.

4. Limitations and Challenges

The adoption of thermal cameras for continuous respiration monitoring presents ad-
vantages; however, several factors, including the placement of cameras and the movement
of the participants, can influence their accuracy and reliability in this application. Nev-
ertheless, Alves et al. [69] concluded, in a lab study, that changes in camera placement,
subject’s static position, and the use of a nasal cannula do not affect the respiration signal
quality. The use of thermal cameras usually implies a trade-off between cost and sensitivity
to small temperature changes. The cost of high-quality/high-resolution cameras may limit
their widespread accessibility. However, using low-cost/low-resolution cameras poses
challenges regarding how accurately subtle respiratory movements can be captured, partic-
ularly when monitoring from a distance. In addition, environmental conditions, such as
external heat sources (e.g., radiator or heated blankets), fluctuations in room temperature,
or adjacent medical devices may interfere with the camera’s ability to reliably detect the
respiration signal. The accuracy of thermal measurements is also susceptible to the move-
ment of the monitored subject. Movements might be erroneously interpreted as respiratory
changes. Furthermore, the positioning of the person in relation to the camera can influence
the quality of data, especially if the person is not facing the camera directly. Furthermore,
the standardization of the procedure to acquire and process thermal videos for respiration
monitoring represents a challenge and entails complex algorithms and signal-processing
techniques. In light of these limitations, ongoing research and technological advancements
are essential to address these challenges and to further develop its applications.

5. Conclusions

The use of thermal cameras to monitor respiration rate and detect apnea cases is being
proven to be of great pertinence. This technique detects temperature changes associated with
respiration airflow and respiration motion. This can bring significant improvements to the
patient’s well-being and to the clinicians’ work and diagnosis methods considering its non-
contact nature. Nevertheless, there is still a need to adapt the technologies and methods that
have been studied in order to make them implementable in a clinical setting for standard use.
These include improving the accuracy and sensitivity of thermal imaging systems, minimizing
the impact of environmental factors on measurements, and developing robust algorithms for
real-time analysis. Additionally, further studies are needed to validate the technology across
larger populations and different clinical conditions. The measurement of the respiration rate
should be comparable to the gold standard and deliver values up to the medical requirements.
The detection of apnea and the distinction between OA and CA should also match the ground
truth given by specialists with adequate accuracy.

Considering all of this, the use of thermal cameras for respiratory monitoring could
improve patient care by offering a convenient non-contact alternative to traditional methods.
Nevertheless, further research and development in this field is essential to mature this
technology for clinical use.
